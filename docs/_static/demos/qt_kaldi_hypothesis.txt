labour and the rest either support other parties or have yet to make up their minds and as ever you can comment on either on twitter our hashtag is bbc two were also on facebook as usual and our text number is a three nine eight one push the red button on your remote to see what others are saying and their leaders this is important don't know the questions that are going to be put to them tonight so first to face our audience please welcome the leader of the conservative party the prime minister theresa may leaving prime minister your first question comes from abigail a tok please why should the public trust anything you say or any of your policies when you have a known track record of broken promises and backtracking during your time as home secretary and now prime minister thank you david thank you thank you have a girl and er can i first of all say good evening to everybody and thank you for your coming to be an audience that this programme tonight which is in port and part of the election campaign let me tell you about some of the things i did as home secretary abigail i said that i would ensure that we were dealing with extreme is take breaches i excluded more than any home secretary before me i said i would do something about stop and search cos i don't think anybody should be stopped and searched on the streets of our country because of the colour of their skin i said i will be tough on crime and i said i would ensure our police and our security services had the powers they need to be able to do their job and i gave them those in the legislation that i put through and i made sure that we kept the records of criminals and terrorists on the dna database where diane abbott actually wants to wipe them clean i don't think that's a good idea cos that helps us catch criminals so no backtracking no broken and promises what were you thinking of her um well you have backtracked as prime minister you backtracked when you became leader of the conservatives and then immediately prime minister after the eu referendum you said you wouldn't call an election you did and then you hear calling an election and refusing to take part in debates and refusing to answer people's questions refusing to talk to jeremy corbyn and you have backtracked on your social care policy and your entire manifesto has holes in it and everyone else can see that i just say i'm not refusing to take part in debates because i'm here answering questions from you this audience this evening that's what i think's important election campaign is not politicians arguing amongst each other but actually listening and taking questions from voters and you mentioned about not holding saying i wouldn't hold an election now holding one you're right i thought we needed a period of stability when i became prime minister but what became clear to me when we went through the article fifty process to trigger the process of leaving the european union to respect the will of the british people was that other parties wanted to frustrate those brexit negotiations and wanted to frustrate that the will of the people that have been expressed in the referendum vote and you it would have been easy i could have said ok i'm prime minister as another couple of years going why don't i just stay and hang on in the job but i didn't do that i called an election because of brexit i was willing to do that because i think this is a really important moment for our country we've got to get this right if we get it right i'm optimistic for the british people because i believe in the british people but we need to get it right yes and the woman there who is it that contested you because labour have clearly issued a whip to get people to vote for article fifty being passed besides the lib dems who have kind of said that they would like another referendum i don't understand who is that has contested the leadership for brexit well you're right we got the article fifty legislation through parliament that was important it's triggered the ability for us to start these negotiations and those negotiations by the way start just eleven days after election day next week so whoever comes in as prime minister whoever comes in as the government has got to be ready to actually get the ball rolling and start those negotiations straight away but it was clear through the discussions that we that we had around that time but the other parties did want to frustrate us and you say you talk about the liberal democrats we have a situation at the moment where if jeremy corbyn was to get into number ten he being propped up by the liberal democrats and the scottish the scottish nationalists you'd have diane abbott who can't add up sitting around the cabinet table john mcdonnell john mcdonald is a marxist nicola sturgeon wants to break our country up and tim farron who wants to take us back into the eu the direct opposite of what the british people want i been said to prime minister and one of the things that i would like to know is secretly do you really regret calling this election now the polls have moved against dionne i'm a tory and i pray and hope that we win but you win but you must feel a little bit of ooh a little bit of remorse no no i know i've been in politics quite a long time and as i've always said at every election the only poll that matters is the one that takes place on polling day and i think the british people have when they're voting every is casting your vote people here and people watching and others have a very simple choice and it is about who do you trust to have that leadership to take us to get the best deal for brexit a brexit deal in europe yeah and who's got the will and the vision not just to take us through brexit not just to get on with the job of delivering brexit but take us beyond and build a better future for this were you were you surprised the poles have gone from a lead of twenty percent when you called the election remorselessly down like that david i'm never surprised at things that happen during election how you thought you were that's a killer and i accept your that pop i'm i'm never sir prized things that happen during election time campaigns because the only poll i look at is the one that takes place on election day a user you called the election for bullet for your own political games it's nothing to do with good good of the country it's your own political gains no it's not it's er can i just say to you i just said a it would have the easiest thing in the world for me having become prime minister after the referendum and david cameron resigned to say you know the next elections not to twenty i'm a you this is a good job i enjoy doing this job i want to do in this job i do what i believe is the best for britain i could've stayed on doing that job for another couple of years and not called your call i had you for for the good of the conservative party have called a general election for the good of the conservative party and it's going to backfire on you know i do high court hi the general election because i believe that the british people have a right to vote and to say who they want to see leading them through the brexit negotiations and i believe they should have a prime minister who has an absolutely resolute determination to respect their will my party is the only party that is going to respect the will of the british people get on with their job and deliver a successful brexit he will come to dress him and one more point from you um i think it's a very different thing to evade a studio audience as in a debating the other leaders i think there's been a lot of debate intruder media and not be would not give more interesting debate having you sadie sting's face to face with the other leaders as speak er that way about politics policies followed then true to v into journalist think election campaign should be about getting out and about yes answering questions from voters meeting voters talking to people across the uk in a whole variety of circumstances i'm afraid i think that that have actually having that interaction with voters is more useful for the voter randall the politician i think anybody wants to be prime minister should be out and about listening to what people are thinking i don't think seven politicians just arguing amongst themselves is actually that interesting all that revealing ok let's er there we go i want to go on because we talked about the election it's gone to talking about brexit but you've mentioned once or twice barry clark can we have your question barry club please good evening good evening if he used that being awkward why don't we just cut and run and pay no money at all i've said that i think no deal would be better than a bad deal but i'm confident we can get a good deal with the right plan for those negotiations but i think a good deal is in our interest and in the interests of the rest of the eu but we have to be prepared to stand up for britain we have to be prepared to go in there recognising that we are not willing to accept a bad deal on this what is it a bad deal people are very confused you talk all the time about a bad deal which you won't accept can you explain what in your mind would be a bad deal yes i think you on the one hand david you've got politicians in europe some of whom are talking about punishing the uk leaving the eu i think what they want to see in terms of that punishment would be a bad deal and secondly you've got politicians here in the united kingdom who seem to be willing to accept any deal whatever it is just for the sake of getting a deal and i think the danger is they'd be accepting the worst possible deal at the highest possible price good evening are you always say you want to surf for the whole people of britain but the brexit was basic voted by fifty percent so how do you actually sir for the whole country of just fifty two percent are back to brexit well the first thing i would say is that as i go around and talk to people and individuals business representatives and others i find that actually the great a majority of opinion here in the uk now is the decision was taken the public were given their choice they chose to leave the european union let's just have a government that gets on with it and delivers a good deal and how i would respond for all of those who voted to remain i voted to remain is to say that now we must make sure we get the negotiations right get that good free trade agreement the continued co operation a deep and special partnership with the eu but also we take this opportunity of brexit new trade deals around the rest of the world actually seeing how we can build a more prosperous stronger and fairer britain i think we can do that i think we can do that because i believe in britain and i believe and the british people just over a year ago when you were a remainder david cameron got this wrong and he resigned you got it wrong and remain to become prime minister remaining inside the european make the european union makes us more prosperous yesterday you said brexit makes us more prosperous i mean what what where you wear you out on this what i i set out very carefully before the referendum why i believed on balance we should stay in the eu i also said the sky will not fall in if we leave the eu what then happened was the british people who had been given the choice no parliament decided to say to the public it's your choice they chose that we should leave the eu will be going back to your own garden you've got to make sure that we can actually use the opportunities that come from brexit we've got to grasp those opportunities but fundamentally david the thing i think that matters most in this is being willing to deliver on the will of the people not saying you've got it wrong let's have a second referendum saying you voted you've chosen you want a government that's going to do it for you i say to people if you voted for brexit you need to make sure you get it with the government with me and my team who will actually deliver for you yeah but the people chose made the wrong choice by your book cos you were a leader they made the wrong choice because you were remain or so in your mind you must have thought what are they on about then you said they'll get richer if they stay if they leave they won't that be poorer can you now honestly say there's no difference we get we get richer by leaving just the same as we would have done if we'd remain which is what i said is there going to be a price i did say at the time that i thought there were advantages on balance in being in the eu but now what i believe we must do is deliver on the will of the people but also make sure we make a success of it so what i'm doing as prime minister is saying let's find those opportunities that will enable us to be more prosperous in the future right too much of me the man over there you sir and on the far side there yes good event or do you say good evening all the time you have met that's a christening likely that we are going to have to pay a divorce bill and speculated anything between nothing two hundred billion could you quantify in billions of pounds straightforward question what is a good deal i'm not going to give you a figure on that for two reasons first of all because we need to go through very carefully what as part of the negotiation what rights and obligations are the united kingdom has and secondly because if i gave you a figure here tonight for what i thought would be a good figure that wouldn't be a very good negotiating stance when i'm sitting down and let it if i'm prime minister in eleven days' time with the european union but it is his money or is it is it is it is it is money spending yes it it's all our money that will be it is taxpayers' money david but you don't go into negotiating to her stance saying the thing i want out of this is absolutely want out of this is is ex because you can bet your bottom dollar the other side to try and make sure you don't get it do you think they'll have to you'll have to agree that before they'll talk about all the other things trade and all the rest of it which we are doing that a day for i've been very clear as indeed has the eu on recognising that we need to negotiate that new relationship with them which will be about trade but will be about other things to do like co operation on security and criminal justice but they want to start off by talking about the the bill i want one of the early discussions to be about the reciprocal arrangement for eu citizens and uk citizens they haven't said we can't negotiate the trade deal until we've agreed the bill what they said is we need to make sufficient progress what several of them have also said we need to get onto the trade deal quickly won the very back there and you've said that you think you can negotiate a good deal but do you really think that you actually have any real level ridge with brussels well yes i do and one of the reasons i think we can negotiate a good deal is because actually a good deal in trade terms is not just of benefit to the uk it's of benefit to businesses in the remaining countries in europe is in remaining in the european union this isn't just about us it's actually about a relationship that matters to them as well as it matters to us you ever hear of the right um just let's pull on the common about diane arbus miscalculations made a few minutes ago cos philip hammond who is the chancellor of the exchequer got twenty billion miscalculation a few weeks ago well what i will they say is this as i said earlier on and diane abbott wants to be home secretary and she wants to wipe the records of criminals and terrorists from the dna database that would mean we could catch fewer criminals and fewer terror you said yes i it's erm talk about brexit and remain as i think the voting fifty two percent to forty eight percent i think it lacked the confidence in asking the public the electors to one more time and because the water was so are in there in the middle what with the lectures wanna do i think nigel farage made a big mess i think michael gove or let the electorate the wrong way and boris johnson the buses but are you a paste with nhs three and fifty million we all tell lies so even people who voted out perhaps they should be given the second chance so you should have the confidence to say shall we have another vote look can i just put it like this over the years in the euro and union and its its european economic community there have been a number of occasions where referendums have been held in countries there's one in ireland i think france's example as well where they voted against what the eu was suggesting and basically the bureaucrats and the eu politicians turned round those countries and said you've got it wrong have another go we want you to come up with what we think is the right answer do you know how that time was that at that so you can come back in at that time i think collectively people here in the uk said you know what that's not the way to behave if the people have given their choice let's listen to the people and actually deliver on it on the rocks we don't give the right information to choose from or get yourself earlier this week prime minister you said that you wanted the people of britain to trust you with regards to brexit and winning the election how come the people trust you when your manifesto is not giving them any detail as to figures or what you propose to do with other things in government what my manifesto right i use that word trust and i used it because that is actually what politicians when we go out when we ask people to vote for us we ask are asking people to trust us in the in the role that we are are being one to be voted into an i if i look at a manifesto what our manifesto has done is to be open with people about the great challenges that we believe that this country faces and that need to be addressed by whoever is in government we've been open about that i've also been open that there will be some hard choices to be made in addressing those various challenges you talk about figures in our manifesto of course we have already have budgets that have been set out in the autumn statement is as government and in the spring budget and we've added some figures in various areas like our extra funding on the nhs and schools in the manifesto but i think it's important that the next government should set out for people the really big issues that are going to have to be addressed by whoever is in government and those are in our manifesto the one the one thing that was missing from your manifesto and seemed to cause a panic in the conservative party was the figures on what happens to people who have to fund their care in old age and we have a question about it from derek griffin let's just have that griffin um i was wondering um with regard to social care um you can spend your whole life obviously working hard to build up a nest egg and have a nice little pension savings he can be comfortable in your later life after you've retired but if it's all going to be taken away from you again if you care is needed then essentially what why should you even bothered in the first place and a reminder that your manifesto said one hundred thousand pounds is all you'll be left with the well and the figure that you're left with that moment is twenty three thousand pounds so we're actually quadrupling that but you see the hundred thousand if i just look at i thought i'd change that i do i thought so i thought you were going to have an upper limit the hundred thousand is a floor david years tap and a floor but you didn't mention the captain i come on to that in your inventions and fester that's all come on a tour of the figures not answer the question i was do i no you're not you're a way look at me the situation at the moment if you need care are then if you've got more than twenty three thousand pounds in savings you have to pay for that care and if you need residential care the value of your house will be taken into account and so it's today that we see people someone having to sell their house in order to pay those bills what we say is that ask them don't the system we introduce which is important because we need a sustainable system for the future given the ageing population if we do nothing a social care system will collapse and we say that we will ensure that people are able to protect more of their savings one hundred thousand pounds that they will also not have to sell their house during their lifetime to pay for their care bills i also wanted a system that was fair across the generations and i believe this is too we said in our manifesto we consult on the details i heard the scaremongering that came out after our manifesto was published and as an and i set out one of the details that were aspects that would've been in the consultation and which is about having a cap on the absolute level there's a floor of one hundred thousand you can protect a hundred thousand and will consult on what should be the cap of the absolute cap on the level of care funny had to leave out the cat cos it's rather important for people one hundred thousand pounds at that you you keep you keep but whether you get rid of half a million or two hundred fifty thousand of that the manifested told you nothing and then you suddenly said oh they'll be a cat we went charging more than certain i want to leave that out isn't it we set out the principles in a manifesto which are the ones that i've i've just sent out in the answer which is crucially that it's fair across the generations that we enable people to have the knowledge and the comfort of knowing they won't have to sell their house in their lifetime to pay for their care but very good welcome back on it because obviously i'm just from a personal perspective i know you're saying about their caps or myself or my wife for instance we actually both er disabled so again statistically as we get older we are maybe more likely to be the ones that are needing to use that care so there any kind of safeguards or guarantees or something that you know we're not going to be left bankrupt in a retirement place is purely because of the condition that we have no control over what i want want to do in relation to the details of the policy how it actually works including the level of the cap is to consult with people consult with voters also consult with organisations charities and others working with older people so that we ensure that we get that right and i think that's a fair way to do it rather than than just producing a figure now i think it's important to have that consultation if you can tell us what the flores now why can't you tell us the cap talking about we're talking about two different things aren't we on the floor i think it's important that we give people the protection of their savings which is greater than it is today and that's why we have set that figure of one hundred thousand but on the cat as to where you set that figure is to the absolute figure that people pay amount that people pay i think it's right that we have that consultation we will consult as i've just said to barry with individuals but also with organisations that deal with these issues that charities that work with older people to make sure that we get that at the right level ok victoria victoria let's go it's not a night out oh sorry yes you're quick we had a couple of years ago for seventy nine thousand i can't really start with something around that figure well the day and we in our manifesto we said we weren't following the deal not those of the the andrew dilnot proposals we weren't going to follow those andrew dilnot proposals and there were two reasons why the first is that those tended to protect people who were wealthier but didn't protect people who are on modest incomes and secondly it required payment out of taxation and i actually think that if you're going to be fair across the generations and we don't ask young people and to be having their taxes increased in order to pay for their social care costs of somebody who made people who may be sitting on a very significant value in their house let's go i think tory or david well yes the nurse for twenty six years to the torrent expect us support in the light of another one percent pay increase i what we're looking at in terms of the national health service and ensuring that we can provide the national health service in the future is if we just look at how much money is now being spent on the nhs and the five years to twenty we will be spending half a trillion pounds on the national health service now we're putting more money in at the moment and we will continue to put more money in into the future into the nhs but it is important that we recognise as you will know as a nurse the demands on the nhs are increasing all the time we recognised the work that the nhs staff do that the nurses get paid less and less nurses nurses get her an increase and obvious another man says well if i were a real terms decrease yeah fourteen percent since two thousand and turn you don't tell us we can already rise let that person next set the mouse at that i agree with that my wage slips from two thousand and nine reflect exactly what i'm earning today so how can that be fair in light of what we the job that we actually do and i recognise the job that you do that we had detained we have now we have had to take some hard choices across the public sector in relation to public sector pay restraint we did that because of the decisions we had to take to bring public spending under control because it wasn't under control under the last labour government and i'm being honest with you in terms of saying that we will put more money into the nhs but there isn't a magic money tree that we can shake that suddenly provides for everything that people want aye aye you coming have you got em you cut in nhs spending but you also cut tax for the rich actually cutting nhs spending we're putting in fact record levels of funding overall into the national health service and we will continue to increase the funding for the national health service in government of so when funding is countries ben way ma'am on their health service than we do but we're giving out for free so why why are we spending less well it's not i mean the figures do vary but actually it's not the case that all other countries are spending more money on the nhs than we are we are putting more funding into the nhs we're putting and we will continue to do that but i also want to do some other things in relation to the nhs we have put into work into it a requirement that mental health should be given parity of esteem with physical health in the nhs i think there is with more money is going into it there but there's more for us to do and in our manifesto we have set out a whole package of what we can do on mental health it's not just about the money that's going into the nhs which will increase it is about ensuring that we're dealing in addressing the issues we need to and i think mental health is something that's been put to one side for too long and not been given the attention it deserves the nurses just for a moment i think it's fair that the nurses get just a one percent increase year in year out regardless of inflation so they get poor as some of them were told go to food banks is that fair do you feel do you sleep happy at that the public sector has been restrained in its paid one percent increase of course there will be those working within the nhs nurses and others who will get progression pay greece or not there was a special case when he's there what that without the other one percent are not a special case nurses compared with other people in the public sector people in the public sector across all sorts of services are working very hard on some jobs that we want them to do because they are about looking after us about protecting us about caring for us but we have to look at public sector spending we have to make sure that we are managing our money carefully because at the end of the day as i say there isn't a magic money tree that suddenly delivers all the money that everybody wants for their spending everybody wants you may hear later on that you can ask for anything you want have money spent on but actually you can't he's not there we have to ensure we manage your money taxpayers' money carefully a lot so you're the one you mentioned the mantel shelf there i'm just wondering does that include the work capability assessment and that with their mental health as well it cos i've just recently filed that assessment so i just couldn't through mental health there's a number of things you want and just used say your bit to you sitting together by chancellor by chance ok we'll say what you're gonna say them gone oh well basically again on mental health i agree it's so important the nhs is absolute shambles for mental health at the moment i applied for nhs counselling about i think probably the end twenty fifteen my first appointment is next tuesday my next appointment is next tuesday i've been waiting a year half for this and i have suffered so much of that year in part because of the work capability he said partially sighted as well i'm partially sighted i have mental health problems and also i have other stews so jaw issue and i went into my assessment and i was asked in detail about suicide attempts and i came out crying because i was so upset because of the way i was treated by that nurse and she came out after me she'd forgotten to measure my eyesight i'm partially sighted she found time to bet to just a you insult me basically by asking for all these up yeah but i cried that runs look look i'm not going to make any excuses for the experience that you've had that's why i think it is so important that we actually did we do deal with mental health you now both of you have raised two different issues one is how we deal with mental health issues in the health service and the other is actually a work capability assessment and this is something where we are we do look at improving what how that assessment has taken place but i know i know your shit i know that the issue of mental health is particularly difficult one to address in terms of those work capability assessments on the national health service and the other things we want to do with mental health and one of the things i want to do is ensure that there is better support in schools so that we have in individual members of staff trained in schools who are able to better identify mental health problems and then know how to address them and i've had me i was talking to a young woman only at the turn of the year who in schools said nobody really known what to be able to do with her with because of her mental health problems and so she suffered as a result if we can give people the support they need at an earlier stage it's better for everybody but act but as i say i make no excuses for the experience i want to know her as the woman is orange there i'm sorry we've got to go on to have only got ten more minutes the prime minister yes i think it's fair to say that mental health funding is one of your sound bites whenever people ask you about the nhs but it really concern me a couple of weeks ago you were filmed when a lady challenged you about her benefits for learning difficulties you turned around and gave her answer about mental health funding and it really concerns me that the prime minister and potential future prime minister of the uk apparently doesn't understand the difference between a learning disability and mental health condition to me back when the lady first spoke to me she talked about learning disabilities and mental health and she'd actually raise mental health herself but recognise that this particular issue that she had was about learning disabilities but look this is that both of these are areas where we need to ensure that we have got the ability for people's needs to be identified at an early as early a stage as possible and then the support goes in all obviously all the evidence is the earlier you can get that support to somebody early you can identify an issue then then the better it is for that individual but also at the better it will be for them for the rest of their lives that's why on mental health front i say i'm so keen to ensure that we get more support in terms of training in schools and other things i want to do as well but getting including in the workplace actually because too often i think there was discrimination in relation to mental health in the workplace so i want to bring a new mental health act get a scrap the old mental health act but also change the equalities legislation so that discrimination on mental health would not be possible in the workplace robert wait let's have you sir robert he i will be the voting tarry but i'm not happy with the foreign aid budget and especially where we're giving money to north korea can you explain that please well we i think the the commitment we have given on the foreign aid budget is an important one and i think it's an important one for two reasons first of all out we are one of them are you know the er how were the fastest growing second fastest growing economy in the g seven last year we are on the most significant economies in the world i think it's right that we say we help those a take on those people who are less well off than we are in those developing countries there are millions of children millions of girls being educated today who would not be educated were it not for the foreign aid money that we're giving but it's also about something else because it means that in certain states it's possible to help to develop the economy the governance of that state and that is of benefit to us in protecting us as united kingdom for a whole range of reasons if we can stabilise some of certain countries then that's going to be better for us both into in terms of security for example robert where you do look very carefully at individual countries and individual payments about north korea that that is that is one of the worst places going surely well it's certainly not somewhere that are i would do it suggests that is somewhere that i hold up as a paragon of virtue i think what the dprk what north korea has been doing in terms of its missiles and it's a nuclear situation and we had another ballistic missile test only a few days ago we are very clear that we want to see those changes in north korea i think it's important for china to be influencing them as the two going career does north korea received money from the aid budget the gentleman has suggested that it that it is i don't know the details of that only in pounds in twenty fifteen four million pounds yeah ok you sir in the red and white checked shirt so you're you're the prime minister of the country you don't know where that foreign aid is going to it's going to government or is actually going to benefit people well if we're if we are putting money into when we put money into countries we change the way we spend the foreign aid budget in the past foreign aid budget was all too often just given to governments and you know the stories in the past have them the way the money was then spent so we work through ngo goes we work through organisations that are helping people so money that we put into countries is targeted on things like education on health on a welfare of people on support for the people who are the most vulnerable ok brief one from you sir earlier of foreign aid money can you explain why it is that a great deal more of a largesse that goes to the rest of the world is not in the form of british manufacturers rather than of cash it's much easier to avoid having a field hospital pocketed than it is a few million of different of cash and it's also the case that if this bunny fed its way through british manufacturing and provided british jobs there would be much less contention concerning the sums of money they won't can you answer briefly first of all some of the money we're talking about is not about buying kit in the sense of things that will be manufactured here i just said if you're talking about education and it's about providing the facilities where children who would not otherwise be educated are being educated um but we do give support to countries in ways other than just the money um so there are some countries where we are indeed a military are working on things like field hospitals and providing those directly if we want to improve british manufacturing and manufacturing around the world that's why i want to ensure we get lots of good trade agreements around the whole of the world when we leave the european union ok sally sally jones he sat selling guns not far away over state schools are underfunded and teachers have ever wet why you put money into grammar schools with state schools are beneficial to al delicacies ok i have stick the grammar school from has yes but sally what with what we're doing the grammar schools will be within the state sector but they might be free schools but there might be others other types of schools we want a diversity of education because education is so important i want every youngster to get the best possible start in life and that means every youngster getting the education that is right for them we are actually putting more money you said we're putting money into were possible for possibility for grammar schools to be set up yes but we are also increasing the overall amount of money that goes into schools and ensuring there is a fairer distribution of that money across the country but i believe it's important that if we know there are good schools out there at the moment we have a law that says you can't set up any more of these types of schools despite the fact that they're good i think that's wrong i should think we should allow those news grammar schools to be set up so we ensure every child gets the education that's right for them the best possible start in life what he from in the school that i work in by twenty every single child in that school will receive eight hundred eight ninety eight pounds per year less than under a labour government in twenty and my question to you is why do you care less about the children the labour government i don't care about that i don't have that per child per there you're saying the per child per pupil spending all has fallen and um by twelve years ago but how much eight hundred ninety eight ok made the point let's blow as there are two things i want to do because i do care about education as i've just said in response to sally i think it is so important for every youngster to get the best start in life and that's why we will be putting more money overall into the schools will be ensuring the pupil premium is there for those children who are a disadvantage we will also ensure that there is a fairer distribution of school funding was at the moment as you probably know there are some schools that get twice the amount of money per pupil than others other schools in other parts of the country i want to see a fairer system of funding and in doing that we will make sure that no school sees a budget cut when that a fairer funding introduced for getting a good quality education isn't just about the money going into schools it's about ensuring that we are encouraging people to come into the teaching profession so we'll give loan student loan forgiveness people who stay come into teaching and stay in teaching it's about a diversity of types of school so is the innovation and creativity in education so we genuinely injured can say in this country that how far you go in life depends not on where you come from or who your parents are but it depends on your talents and your abilities and your willingness to work hard fred got a couple of minutes left matt randy he dundee holder let's have your question um why haven't you signed a letter to donald trump condemning his decision to pull out of the paris climate change agreement something which the it's germany france and italy have done yes and er i haven't because i i actually have spoken to donald trump and told him that the uk believes in the paris agreement and we didn't want the united states to leave the paris agreement at the g seven leaders sat round the table last week and spoke to were told donald trump that the six of us told him that we believe the paris agreement was an important international agreement on climate change that we wanted the united states to stay in it i've spoken to him i spoke to him last night about this what he's sadder and japan haven't signed the letter either what sorry say what did he say he says he's taken the decision because he thinks it's in the best interest of america i say that the paris agreement actually is important for us globally in terms of dealing with climate change that's why the uk supported it it's why the uk is to your your your negotiating your negotiating our departure from the eu would he'd have been sensible and prudent to go along with france and germany and italy and sign a letter to donald trump and said if it being released that you just said you were disappointed by his decision it's not a question of when we should go along with somebody else david we take independent decision as the uk i spoke to donald trump i've told him my views from the uk his position last week i told him last night what a views are we remain committed to the paris agreement we continue to think it's important for dealing with climate change internationally well that i'm afraid ends the first half of this programme prime minister thank you very much thank you very much and now will you please welcome the leader of the labour party jeremy corbyn good evening good evening mr corbett our first question to you comes from kieran hepworth please and why should the british public trust you and pays to negotiate brexit why should the british public trust you and your peers to negotiate brexit thank you for inviting me here tonight i'm very sorry this is not a debate this is a series of questions i think it's a shame the prime minister a very very clear on brexit the referendum took place a decision was reached leaving european union secondly we will immediately legislate in office to guarantee the rights of eu nationals to remain in this country secondly we will negotiate with the european union to guarantee trade access to european markets and protection of the conditions that we've achieved to eu membership because it's crucial protect our manufacturing industry your point about a negotiating team we have a great team a great team of very experienced people kissed amma is one of the leading lawyers of this country i think i can trust kissed armour with negotiations more than some other people who are undertaking those negotiations on question time last night your international trade secretary barry gardiner said that britain would absolutely absolutely was his word the poorer after leaving the eu do you agree with that i don't think we necessarily would be poorer i hope that we will retain as i said the trade access i hope also that we will have a labour government will be investing in a growing economy in this country and challenging the terrible levels of inequality that exists in this country at the same time you sir david cameron went to the eu and asked for a few concessions he got nothing because they knew that he would stay in you would want to stay in the eu if the eu and understands your position that no deal he's a bad day then you've got no chance here i've made it very clear we accept the results the referendum and i think it's important to go from that point i've made the point also about the need for trade access to the european union and there is of course an interesting that on both sides the channel most of our big manufacturing companies have supply chains here and in europe and vice versa there is a mutual interest in this but we're not approaching these negotiations by threatening europe with setting up some kind of low tax haven for big corporations in this country we instead saying we want to continue that trading relationship outside the european union but i think a sensible relationship with them is very important and i would approach those negotiations to build up a trust which gives us that sensible relationship in the future what you're not exactly what exactly do you think the british people meant who voted to leave what do you understand by leave the eu what does that actually mean to you to label the eu what is it that matters and that leaving the european union means withdraw from the treaty of rome we withdraw from the nineteen seventy two decision was made by the british government at that time to join the european union it means that there is no longer a legislative authority over uk law within the eu or a parliamentary consent for it it means we have to have an independent and separate relationship with the european union and i think we've got two years to negotiate it and i can't wait to get started and to make sure that we do retain manufacturing industry and service industry jobs in britain that are so essential to our economy and the economic gross you threatening will not work is your aim to remain there you are and you enter in the single market do you think that's possible our aim is to have a tariff free trade access to europe i think we should put it in those terms rather than anything else at this stage ok you sir over there the far side no the man over there that's it cos he's spoken already you will learn will you rule out doing a deal with nicola sturgeon in the event of a hung parliament because you will be negotiating you would expect with the eu we are fighting this election to win and we're mounting a fantastic campaign in order to get that message across of how different our society and our politics could be we are contesting all the constituencies we are not looking to do deals with anybody we are not forming a coalition government i want to form a labour government with a majority to carry out this amazing programme which can give so much ok so he has at eight it did but it wasn't the answer to my question i thought you're there i thought the question was about deals and i said no deals ok i gotta get something else you said there in the brochure given the absence of the european court of justice how when you uphold government accountability post brexit on environmental issues for example a pollution were already breaching limits european court of justice holds two accounts what will happen when we leave i want to ensure that the environmental protocols are adopted into uk law i think it's very important to do that it's also absolutely crucial for the future of all of us that we have agreements with all of europe be they part of the eu or not on air pollution on air quality on sea pollution and protection of our seas and our natural environment and i'm very determined to achieve that and since you raise the subject i utterly deplore donald trump's decision to withdraw from the paris climate change i would sign a letter with any other leader that would you've got that straight away yeah let's er yeah let's let's come home for a moment of steve run let's have your question please yeti rudd i it yes i am a small local business um i'm faced with the possibility of higher corporation tax rates obviously we've alluded to the uncertainty that brexit will create over the next couple of years and today you've talked about creating jobs and i just wonder how i can have confidence that those jobs while eyes are small business can create those jobs well i don't know how big your small businesses so lycra businesses small micro service business this big that big but i employ five people oh small business but it could grow good let's hope it does glow growing in uncertain times that's absolutely what you just specify again what are your problems with the proposals that labour's making well obviously it's it's the rise in corporation tax is the uncertainty of brexit and that the outcome from brexit it's is planning ahead basically my problem is ok and obviously we've got the personal taxation issues that you know creating crate and other issues that further down the line i'm sure you recognise there are huge problems in the funding of our public services health education and these have to be addressed and dealt with we have a fully costed and fully funded manifesto here that will cost yes and we will raise corporation tax up to twenty six p by the end of the parliament that will be actually two percent lower than it was in two thousand ten will actually less than the g seven average it will also do is not to raise corporation tax for small and medium businesses by that amount some will have no rise whatsoever and we have had a very interesting and very good discussions with a lot of small businesses about their problems accessing capital their problems are growing because banks don't like them are not interested in them and the need to have an investment strategy for this country so on top of that we will also be forming a national investment bank to improve infrastructure all across the country and develop new high technology industries which i think are the future of this country unharness or heart let the people with the skills actually develop the jobs and develop the industries in this country and so yes we are asking the very biggest corporations to pay a bit more but i tell you what i think it's worth it it's worth it so that any young person can go to university and not leave with debt it's worth it to make sure school head teachers don't have to collect at the school gate in order to pay the teachers' salaries i think it's worth it for a better society in which everyone can achieve something come back to you i'm also working for a while nothing to accountancy firm so we to deal with large businesses as well as potential clients and existing clients mike much much choice basically along choice of appliances a conservative government and a labour government and the difference he said two percent looking at a european wide it's a nine percent difference between what the conservatives are proposing corporation tax for large businesses and what the labour government it was it's a fair question but i would simply say this all of your clients i'm sure require workers at various times they require skilled workers at various times if we as a society don't look at the problems throughout our school and education system and investing it properly where are the skilled workers going to come from tomorrow where are gonna be the consumers of tomorrow i think it's time that we looked at in inequality in our society and used a public investment in order to improve services and give real chances to everybody poverty is a waste people who can't get the education they want and the qualifications they want we all lose it's a question of whether the community gets together to support everybody or we just let the rich get richer and the rest suffer what's this that's it what's the overall increase in the tax take that a labour if it comes to power would do would expect what what kind of percentage on the current tax get forty eight billion more how much what percent is that what comes in at the moment forty eight billion more which is quite a small proportion of the total the point i'm making is that what we've got here is funding of it through corporation tax funding of it through some new taxes at ninety five percent ninety five percent of the people of this country will pay no more in tax the eighty or national insurance companies will be asked to pay a bit more and i think it's the right thing to do because it does give us that a growing economy the the figures for the country as a whole the economy as a whole is very nearly a ten percent increase in tax take by the government brings into question from jack rowse if i'm a jack rowse please where is jack grouse yes speak away speak away hijack is labour's manifesto a realistic wishlist or is it just a letter to santa claus i urge you to read it i think it is a serious and realistic document that addresses the issues that many people in this country face we've been brave enough to put it out there with all the policies that are in it how we deal with the school funding crisis how we make sure preschool all children two to four get thirty hours of childcare per week or opportunities for pre school play and education how we bring back the educational maintenance allowance so that youngsters who would be deterred from staying on at school or going on to get a levels or other qualifications and that those who can get into university won't end up with debts of fifty or sixty thousand at the end of it this is nothing unusual in many other countries in the world i think it's time for us to invest in our future the other crisis i my mention david is the question of health the question of mental health and the question of social care if we don't address it what happens what happens is more people suffer what happens is more women usually give up work to care for those who cannot be cared for because we're not putting enough money into it and those with a mental health crisis suffer alone don't get the help and support they want we have to respect the needs of people and frankly challenge all of us to say if we want to live in a society that genuinely cares for all we've got to be prepared to deal with the issues of inequality and pay for it and i'm prepared to do that ok oh yeah it's a question of funding it and i'm thinking of last time labour were in government the left not at the chancellor's office saying we have no money left what i would say is there the past seven years of austerity that austerity has hit public sector workers with the one percent cap is hit all our schools and public services it has caused a housing crisis and you know what the very richest our society have got richer there's been more and more tax giveaways at the top end and more and more charges at the other end it's time to rebalancing our manifesto is a serious well thought out document that i believe is getting a lot of support and people are very excited by the idea of how we could do things differently he said you say this manifesto serious and well thought out and you speak about creating an equal society free from racism and anti semitism but how can i believe a word of this when you as party leader have failed to expel one of your members ken livingstone for his anti semitic remarks there there is no place for anti semitism anywhere in our society and certainly not in our party members have been suspended if they have committed any remarks he's not really seemed to be how to be seen to be of an anti semitic nature those that have done that are suspended we have a process that is independent of me within the party which investigates these and makes a decision on it i deplore racism in any form whatsoever the way in which the jewish people have suffered down the centuries the holocaust and all that went with it was the most appalling stain in the history of mankind i believe we have to fight racism in any form with every fibre of our being a society that cannot challenge racism is a society that is heading for division i will not tolerate and a fast he that's so important to you how are you sir fine some only suspending him for a short period of time how was it not enough to he has been suspended and further investigations may or may not happen after the election but he is suspended from membership but he's suspended so that the investigation into her as the woman there on the gangway you yes you are i am i heard you recently commented that black and ethnic minorities potential has been like locked her and conservatives and you plan to kind of free up and on rockets i just want some clarification as to how exactly planned to do it sorry can i didn't follow you hear the question of the camera right in front that i'm sorry about that i said there was a recent comment by red and news about you and purporting that black and ethnic minorities potential had been locked and conservatives and soldiers on some clarification as to how you'd free up or knock it will in that regard the issues are of poverty in britain the issues are of differential levels of spending in inner city areas compared to other areas and there are serious issues about the number of young black people particularly young men who are part of the criminal justice system end up in youth youth custody or you or use a youth justice institutions or those that end up in mental health institutions i think we have to look very seriously at levels of racism within our society if you like erm racism that almost an institutionalised nature that has to be looked at and one of the issues we put forward was consider how difficult it can be for somebody with an african name or a muslim name to get a short list to get an interview for a job compared to others and so i suggest it's a suggestion it's may become our policy is that we should have them blind applications for jobs where there's no name involved as merely description of your skills and your ability and your qualifications so that there can be a fair assessment of that person because we are a multi ethnic multilingual multicultural society he doesn't treat everybody equally and give everybody a decent chance then we end up with poverty we end up with discrimination and we end up with divisions i want to see a country that comes together and is not divided and apparent by poverty or by discrimination he may come back education and the economy in a moment but let's have this question from adam murder troy please adam oh good if britain were under imminent threat from nuclear weapons how would you react i'll do everything i can to ensure that any threat is actually dealt with earlier on by negotiations and by talks so that we do adhere to a record obligations under the nuclear non proliferation treaty that we do encourage china in its work in trying to bring about six party talks in the resolving the issue in north korea and we do follow the leads that president obama took in doing a deal with iran which would result in them not developing the nuclear capability i think the idea of anyone ever using a nuclear weapon anyone where in the world is utterly appalling and terrible it would result in the destruction of their lives and communities and environment for millions of people and so i would be actively engaged to ensure that danger didn't come about i would also be very aware of other dangers that we face cyber attacks hit a national health service a couple of weeks ago the dreadful terrorist attack in manchester indicates the danger of individual acts of terrorism that can take lives we have to be secure here we have to protect our society and our country but we also have to engage in the rest of the world to make sure we don't have huge uncovered spaces such as in libya which can become the basis of some terrible events that are going to take the lives of many other people who have to deal with those issues here and globally that is the function of responsible government you're um committed to renewing trident are you saying there are no circumstances in which you'd use a nuclear weapon i'm saying all our party has committed to renewing trident that was a decision taken by the party conference indeed taken by parliament i would view the idea of having to use a nuclear weapon as something that was result resulting in a failure in the whole world diplomatic system there has to be no first use there has to be a process of engagement to bring about ultimately global nuclear disarmament is not going to happen quickly it's not gonna happen easily but we have to have that wish you cannot have countenance a world in which we could all be destroyed by nuclear war you see no first use in you wouldn't use you wouldn't push the button in first use in retaliatory use would you you well nuclear weapons that you're wealthy his weapon is there is it i say no first use of the weapon and i think that has to be the basis on what we do adams that answer your question john come back on it incredibly concerning that you wouldn't ever commit to doing that's our safety we had to look at first and foremost and government but what particularly nice views that trident isn't just for heaven forbid a potential carbon government it goes long beyond that are many decades into the future so when you're making the decision whether to support this and that is not just for right here right now it's threats that can face but we have to do everything we can obviously to protect ourselves but the best protection is having good and reasonable relationship to the rest of the world so we don't descend into a mentality where there are military blocks starting threatening each other and i'm utterly determined to do everything i can to bring about a more peaceful world i've spent a lot of my life with un and other organisations trying to bring about principal no first use principles of disarmament and principles of bringing about peace around the world that surely is something we can all work for i think we have to recognise that there is deep deep inequality and injustice in the world but the threats are as i said a cyber security and terrorism the other threats are actually of environmental disaster around the world and large numbers of people fleeing from environmental disaster in effect environmental refugees which is why i was so disappointed in president trump's decision particularly in view of what we achieved by people working together to try and protect and sustain this planet we've only got one planet let's get together when we live on it and above all let's not destroy it can we just come there are just come back to them a clear issue you a prime minister you said you would have no first use you wouldn't countenance britain's nuclear deterrent would your party is restoring and rebuilding maintaining you wouldn't have her first use and that raises a question he said under direct attack would you use it in retaliation as prime minister you're speaking to the country about what you would do with the most expensive defence weapon that we have are you saying you would never use it that's ace the most effective use of it is not to use it because it's there sorry you're dodging the question aren't you i'm saying are you there no sir can look he's under which you'd use it any sir some senses where anyone's prepared to use a nuclear weapon is disastrous for the whole planet that is why there has to be a policy of disarmament and a globally but through a multi natural multilateral policy not a unilateral that's the ideal but what about the reality where you're faced with the prospect of two men just he just asking for a simple reality the reality is that we have to obviously try to protect ourselves we would not use its first use and if we did use it millions are going to die you have to think this thing through a side of the circumstances a time for it yeah you said that you would you use it a second youth or would you allow north korea also media in iran to bon mots and then say oh we better start talking you'll be too late would allow them to do it of course not because what that does that is why i made the point a short time ago about the need for president obama's agreement with iran to be upheld it's quite important actually and also to promote disarmament and career that is difficult i've pre shape but impossible well impossible or are you trying to do you up there yeah you're asking a massive wish when you've got one of the biggest arsenal's by his side a i'd rather have it and not use it than not have it all especially in today's day and age if you want to comment on that i do all right anybody you're the woman there yes that's a stick with us and move on yes i have a question regarding human rights but this is use your question just before i don't know somewhere everyone in this room seems so keen on killing millions of people from that particular gone no you tell them they're to people and i want to ask a question about your immigration policy you've mentioned that you want to reunite families specifically that have being forced apart by theresa may's current migration policies myself my husband's recording this in america as he's at work he was deported in december he was told he was too highly educated despite studying here um getting an undergraduate and master's degree invested a lot in this country i want to know whether you would consider reducing the financial threshold for family migration to be further in line with the national minimum wage for living wage yes our manifesto has addressed this issue is very painful some of the decisions that are made where the frankly arbitrary level of income is chosen couples split apart families split apart and people like her the person you're talking about have invested a huge amount of time and energy into this country then removed from this country who loses we all those family loses their children lose we lose as society and we will change those immigration laws so that there can be a proper family reunion i think there has to be the right and sensible thing to do are you a favour he owned favour reducing immigration overall into this country or what's i think will happen is this that we have a managed migration from outside europe which is based on family reunion and skill needs more investment we have at the moment free movement from within the european union that ends we leave the european union will then have to be managed migration from europe we have to also recognise that those have migrated this country made a massive contribution to our society i the health of all of us as depended depends on the work that's done by many people have made their homes here what i think will happen is there will probably be some reduction in european migration because we will also prevent there being out recruitment of a groups of low paid workers from central europe to come here to undermine existing conditions are often not very good themselves and their damage the life chances of people in this country and be not actually very good for those have been brought in so we'll end overseas only recruitment and end those contract arrangements by which people have brought in particularly in the construction industry you see you're just have another issue which we do have to address that is the skill shortage and skilled problem in britain because we have not invested enough in industrial training we have not invested enough in skilled training we have not invested enough in training more doctors or nurses in this country until we do that we got a big problem and so a whole approach approached our manifesto is about investment for the future and judge what you're a brexit secretary shadow brexit secretary sir keir starmer said which there'd been a huge amount of immigration over the last ten years people understandably concerned about i think it should be reduced when people voted brexit you think immigration was at the forefront of their mind i think it was a big factor in it i don't think it was the only factor but it was a big factor there is also an issue that a communities and local government are often not sufficiently funded to deal with groups of people coming in so we would restore what gordon brown had in ninety two thousand nine to migrant impact fund i have one or two more people come to you and then we go on to question coming up mike yes gone away mr corbyn we talk about the weapons before the one thing that worries me more at the moment as somebody is growing up in a family business is the changes the minimum wage i read your manifesto yesterday and you are planning on increasing minimum wage to ten pounds now the current plan for the national living wage and forecast so that up to sixty thousand people could lose their jobs because of those increases in wages so firstly how many jobs what statistic have you been given by your economist to whoever works for you as to how many jobs will be lost if it goes up to ten if it goes up to ten pounds an hour and secondly how will you help that three million micro businesses in the united kingdom who employ many people a minimum wage and already struggle to do that they're fair point question the minimum wage was first introduced by the labour government after nineteen ninety seven election there were a lot of similar concerns and predictions which turned out not to be the case and in fact there was not any substantial number of jobless called it the release catch up and it's been cut the wage increases were so small if you look at the economic and comments around that time wage increases were so small all the commentator said that this is a massive waste change there such a big margin of error now and your policies and what was brought in in nineteen ninety nine you come back come back to your point what we're proposing is ten pound an hour by twenty twenty that would be a living wage that would reduce our department work and pensions bill somewhat because you'd be reducing in work benefit payments to people being paid more there are many big companies that could well afford to pay it and shouldn't be just paying the minimum wage there are companies like a suspect yours small companies that would have problems we fully recognise that we were therefore work with them either to give them tax relief for support in order to make sure that the living wage the real living wage was paid but they didn't close down as a result of it because as a society we have six million people earning less than the living wage a million people on zero hours contracts we have wage levels as a proportion of national income actually falling at the present time i think in their pockets will mean people are better off but also be an economic boost itself i absolutely recognise the problems for small and micro businesses that's why there would be a pathway to it for them with support from the government to achieve it and edward had edward robbins has sir mr corbyn just mention the issue and robins where is edward robin's put your hand where are you there yes good ah yeah zero hours contracts provide an easy way for students like myself to get casual flexible work how was scrapping these contracts affect us labour policy to scrap zero hours contract first of all zero hours contracts for many people mean a lifetime of stress and a lifetime of great difficulty imagine what it's like it was your sole source of income is a zero hours contract job you wake up in the morning you look at your mobile phone and see if your employer wants that day or not that week or not you don't know what your income is going to be now i do understand the point about students and others some companies some employers say ok we need people in a bar in a shop in a packaging place those kind of enterprises we will pay you x number of hours per week on a flexible basis so that you will have an average pay of say ten hours per week that means those people are loyal to the company those people know what their income is going to be and that seems to me a much fairer way of doing it so you have some security what's going on and there are some employers that do that in towns with a large student population with students and it works quite well am i what well i'm not gonna stop you working it's ok you know where i was talking about more coming from us having the option for students and a scapegoat employed to say we want to work this time this time not just getting told you but you're working this many are working when you choose yes you're the so called gig economy like riding for delivery services yes i think the agreement should be that you come to a discussion with the employer i can work for three hours on monday six thousand thursday two hours at weekends something like that and that's my work pattern it's it's not simple to manage for any employer i fully understand that but it does give the security to the individual it also gives the employer a wide range of work for workers that we're working and will be loyal to their employer and you said back there why have you never regarded the ira is terraced i've had it for the all acts of terror is it by anybody in northern ireland or anywhere else and i think the good friday agreement was a huge achievement was brought about when both communities recognise their shared but different past and brought about the idea of a power sharing government in northern ireland i think that was an enormous achievement and it's been copied elsewhere in the world as a way forward i don't approve of any terrorism any sort or any terrorist acts of any sort it only divides communities and kills people culottes i mean he he did kill a lot of people didn't they all deaths are wrong or killing is wrong we have to develop and we did in northern ireland eventually a very effective peace process i think we should pay tribute to those in the unionist community as well as those the nationalist community for coming together to bring about the peace process it was a truly remarkable experience and you sir yes you didn't watch the me yeah i thought you had that you've got the microphone over your head you all rise well you said you didn't support the oil i and you've also supported a mas and other terrorist organisations a do you suspect the british people to vote for you to go and number ten when you suck then supported then we seen you he had not supported any of those organisations what i've said is and i'm sure you probably agree with that if you were to bring about a peace process anywhere in the middle east bit ireland be in a different situation say colombia or anywhere else there has to be a coming together at some point to that college where do the fit in there people they have a minute till when you tuck into that there has to be well i was talking to representatives of the one of the republican movement yes actually so was the government at the same time ian paisley was indeed thrown out of parliament when he told the government told margaret thatcher she was actually talking to them d'you know what i voted in paisley shouldn't be thrown out of parliament thought his voice should be heard in parliament you have to bring about a peace process by talking to people that you don't agree with you just talk amongst you're not going to go keep poking the man in front of you wanting to speak to me again what you owe me so he would you want to speak are you trying just because it's done on like what i can do ok you've talked to these people the party talked earlier and i talk about the nuclear option talking is the way you want to go yeah david often sets and programmes tongued public to press red button are you saying you'll never ever under any circumstances press the red button i think we've discussed this at some length about the aspirations we all have i do not want be responsible for destruction of billions of people neither do you there we have to go and i just went back to economics it's all very well for a socialist to stand there with his very nice little red book and say we're going to fund all these lovely programmes by taking more money from big business but what's your plan for the economy when those businesses turn round and say ok keep your high taxes will go elsewhere you look at the business we're talking about actually doing very well they've done extremely well over the past six years because their tax have been cut a great deal i think we have to look at the problems of our public services we have to look at the issues of what kind of economic future we have we cannot go on being a low wage economy under spending on our public services investing less than any other industrialised country in our future i would much prefer that we develop a national investment bank and strategy regionally based to improve rail broadband road communications we improved investment in our industry for the future we have a lower proportion of manufacturing industry in germany we have a lower level of productivity than germany with a lower skill base than germany why is there a difference because successive german governments almost irrespective of which party is a being prepared to invest in their infrastructure and their future i think we should think about that and improve the economy of our own society and you know what that would lead to better economic growth it would lead to better opportunities for everybody and i think this is an offer that's important i think it's time that we actually invested in our future rather than presided over a decline but he seemed to say you're saying businesses may scupper under the weight of extra taxation well then there's already that issue of uncertainty with brexit anyway we've seen certain companies of one hour in and saying we stay with girl well if you say to them what you gonna pay more tax when you stay here as well so we don't have to stay well actually the corporation tax level that i'm proposing would actually be less than there is anywhere in the major industrial countries of western europe anyway the crucial thing and you're right to raise it has to be gaining tariff free trade access to the european market as the basis on which they can continue with look at it this way if airbus are in this country as they are they manufacture aircraft parts they manufacture satellite parts and the final assembly of the aircraft takes place in toulouse some of the parts are made here some of the engines are made in other places some parts are made in spain that final assembly takes place if we don't have that tariff free access to european markets are they going to stay would they want to stay ask yourself that question you could say the same for many other big manufacturing enterprises that is why the crucial thing has to be maintaining that economic relationship with europe outside membership of the european union that is the best way of guaranteeing jobs and growing manufacturing economy in britain but also the government is investing alongside them to improve skill levels and improve communication a very there's a point from you so that would take one last question quick if you're nervous security earlier a few months ago you quoted on top well you said on television that one of the things you would do if you were successful and coming into government was performed a strategic defence review have you just gone through a strategic defence review why do we need another one every government comes into office does a strategic defence review there are serious issues about the shortage of ships in the navy there are serious issues about supplies of frigates there are serious issues about maritime surveillance aircraft are not available that have to be addressed there's a crucial issue of cyber security and cyber attacks have taken place on us as a crucial issue about terrorist attacks i don't believe you make society safer by getting rid of twenty thousand police officers as this government has done since two thousand eight the hand to hand in so hannah lynsey but very quickly there hannah if you want is it right to scrap university tuition fees are such an immediate priority when there's so much else that needs doing in terms of living quality for so many people in britain and just to say it's tighter a toe it cost a quarter of your entire spending why universe i think we should invest in education for the future and i do think that abolishing university tuition fees means that any young person has then got the chance to go to university than get in if you look at the process of applications at the moment number of working class students is dropping number coming from poorer communities is dropping i want to see real access for everybody i think that's the right thing to do it would not be unusual in many other parts of the world to do this listen as a young person basically i had the offer of free education i didn't take it up that was my choice and i'm not i'm not complaining about it i don't think it's up to me and my generation to pull up the ladder on the generations coming behind ok but i want to see an education system that really does work for all so that every child can develop to their full potential irrespective of their background and their life chances they were musical and i'm sorry we have to stop you there thank you very much indeed but i've got someone once so that so that brings us brings us to the end of this edition of her thank you thank you all the time here to york to put questions to the two parties we are going to be back on sunday for a second his programme nicola sturgeon of the snp tim farron the liberal democrats that's a five to six on bbc one on sunday until then from york","punct":"Tonight, the Prime Minister, Theresa May the leader of the Conservative Party and the leader of the Labour Party. Jeremy Corbyn face the voters. Welcome. So, over the next ninety minutes. The leaders of the two larger parties are going to be quizzed by our audience here in York. Now, this audience is made up like this. Just say they intend to vote. Conserve it the same numbers say they're going to vote Labour and the rest either support other parties or have yet to make up their minds and as ever. You can comment on either on Twitter. Our hashtag is BBC Two were also on Facebook as usual. And our text number is a three, nine, eight one, push the red button on your remote to see what others are saying and their leaders. This is important, don't know the questions that are going to be put to them tonight. So, first to face our audience. Please welcome the leader of the Conservative Party. The Prime Minister, Theresa May. Leaving Prime Minister. Your first question comes from Abigail. A Tok, please. Why should the public trust anything you say or any of your policies. When you have a known track record of broken promises and backtracking during your time as Home Secretary. And now Prime Minister. Thank you, David. Thank you. Thank you have a girl. And, er. Can I first of all say, Good evening to everybody. And thank you for your coming to be an audience that this programme tonight, which is in port and part of the election campaign. Let me tell you about some of the things I did as Home Secretary, Abigail. I said that I would ensure that we were dealing with extreme is take breaches. I excluded. More than any Home Secretary before me. I said I would do something about. Stop and search, cos I don't think anybody should be stopped and searched on the streets of our country because of the colour of their skin. I said I will be tough on crime and I said I would ensure our police and our security services had the powers. They need to be able to do their job and I gave them. Those in the legislation that I put through and I made sure that we kept the records of criminals and terrorists on the dna database where Diane Abbott actually wants to wipe them clean. I don't think that's a good idea. Cos that helps us catch criminals. So no backtracking. No broken and promises. What were you thinking of her. Um. Well, you have backtracked as Prime Minister, you backtracked when you became leader of the Conservatives and then immediately. Prime Minister after the eu referendum. You said, You wouldn't call an election. You did. And then you hear calling an election and refusing to take part in debates and refusing to answer people's questions refusing to talk to Jeremy Corbyn and you have backtracked on your social care policy and your entire manifesto has holes in it and everyone else can see that I just say I'm not refusing to take part in debates because I'm here answering questions from you this audience, this evening. That's what I think's important election campaign is not politicians, arguing amongst each other, but actually listening and taking questions from voters and you mentioned about not holding saying I wouldn't hold an election now holding one. You're right. I thought we needed a period of stability. When I became Prime Minister. But what became clear to me when we went through the article fifty process to trigger the process of leaving the European Union to respect the will of the British people. Was that other parties wanted to frustrate those brexit negotiations and wanted to frustrate that the will of the people that have been expressed in the referendum vote. And you. It would have been easy. I could have said, OK. I'm Prime Minister as another couple of years going. Why don't I just stay and hang on in the job, but I didn't do that I called an election because of brexit I was willing to do that because I think this is a really important moment for our country. We've got to get this right. If we get it right. I'm optimistic for the British people because I believe in the British people, but we need to get it right. Yes And the woman there. Who is it that contested you because Labour have clearly issued a whip to get people to vote for Article fifty being passed. Besides, the Lib Dems who have kind of said that they would like another referendum. I don't understand. Who is that has contested the leadership for brexit Well, you're right. We got the article fifty legislation through Parliament. That was important. It's triggered the ability for us to start these negotiations and those negotiations by the way. Start just eleven days after election day. Next week. So whoever comes in as Prime Minister. Whoever comes in as the government has got to be ready to actually get the ball rolling and start those negotiations. Straight away, but it was clear through the discussions that we that we had around that time. But the other parties did want to frustrate us. And you say you talk about the Liberal Democrats. We have a situation at the moment where if Jeremy Corbyn was to get into Number ten, he being propped up by the Liberal Democrats and the Scottish. The Scottish Nationalists. You'd have Diane Abbott, who can't add up sitting around the Cabinet table. John mcdonnell John Mcdonald is a Marxist Nicola Sturgeon wants to break our country up and Tim Farron. Who wants to take us back into the eu the direct opposite of what the British people want. I been said to prime minister and one of the things that I would like to know is secretly. Do you really regret calling this election. Now, the polls have moved against Dionne. I'm a Tory and I pray and hope that we win. But you win. But you must feel a little bit of. Ooh. A little bit of remorse. No, no. I know. I've been in politics. Quite a long time. And as I've always said at every election. The only poll that matters is the one. That takes place on polling day and I think the British people have when they're voting every is casting your vote people here and people watching and others have a very simple choice. And it is about who do you trust to have that leadership to take us to get the best deal for brexit A brexit Deal in Europe. Yeah. And who's got the will. And the vision, not just to take us through brexit Not just to get on with the job of delivering brexit But take us beyond and build a better future for this. Were you were you surprised the Poles have gone from a lead of twenty percent when you called the election remorselessly down like that David. I'm never surprised at things that happen during election, how you thought you were. That's a killer and I accept your that. Pop, I'm. I'm never Sir prized things that happen during election time campaigns because the only poll. I look at is the one. That takes place on election day, a user. You called the election for bullet for your own political games. It's nothing to do with good, good of the country. It's your own political gains. No, it's not. It's, er. Can I just say to you. I just said, A, it would have the easiest thing in the world for me. Having become Prime Minister after the referendum and David Cameron resigned to say you know the next elections. Not to twenty I'm a you. This is a good job. I enjoy doing this job. I want to do in this job. I do what I believe is the best for Britain. I could've stayed on doing that job for another couple of years and not called your call. I had you for. For the good of the Conservative Party have called a general election for the good of the Conservative Party and it's going to backfire on. You know. I do. High Court Hi The general election because I believe that the British people have a right to vote. And to say who they want to see leading them through the brexit negotiations. And I believe they should have a prime minister who has an absolutely resolute determination to respect their will my party is the only party. That is going to respect the will of the British people get on with their job and deliver a successful brexit He will come to dress him and one more point from you. Um. I think it's a very different thing to evade a studio audience as in a debating the other leaders. I think there's been a lot of debate. Intruder media and not be would not give more interesting debate, having you, Sadie. Sting's face to face with the other leaders as speak. Er, that way about politics policies followed, then. True to V into journalist. Think election campaign should be about getting out and about. Yes, answering questions from. Voters meeting voters talking to people across the UK in a whole variety of circumstances. I'm afraid I think that that have actually having that interaction with voters is more useful for the voter Randall. The politician. I think anybody wants to be Prime Minister should be out and about listening to what people are thinking. I don't think seven. Politicians just arguing amongst themselves is actually that interesting. All that revealing. OK, let's, er. There we go. I want to go on because we talked about the election. It's gone to talking about brexit But you've mentioned once or twice. Barry Clark. Can we have your question, Barry Club, please. Good evening. Good evening. If he used that being awkward. Why don't we just cut and run and pay no money at all I've said that I think. No Deal would be better than a bad deal, but I'm confident we can get a good deal with the right plan for those negotiations. But I think a good deal is in our interest and in the interests of the rest of the eu but we have to be prepared to stand up for Britain. We have to be prepared to go in there recognising that we are not willing to accept a bad deal on this. What is it a bad deal. People are very confused. You talk all the time. About a bad deal which you won't accept. Can you explain what in your mind would be a bad deal. Yes, I think you on the one hand. David, you've got politicians in Europe. Some of whom are talking about punishing the UK, leaving the Eu I think what they want to see in terms of that punishment would be a bad deal. And secondly, you've got politicians here in the United Kingdom who seem to be willing to accept any deal. Whatever it is just for the sake of getting a deal and I think the danger is they'd be accepting the worst possible deal at the highest possible price. Good evening. Are you always say you want to surf for the whole people of Britain. But the brexit Was basic voted by fifty percent. So how do you. Actually, sir. For the whole country of just fifty two percent are back to brexit Well, the first thing I would say is that as I go around and talk to people and individuals business representatives and others. I find that actually the great. A majority of opinion here in the UK now is the decision was taken the public were given their choice. They chose to leave the European Union. Let's just have a government that gets on with it and delivers a good deal. And how I would respond for all of those who voted to remain. I voted to remain is to say that now. We must make sure we get the negotiations. Right, get that good. Free Trade Agreement, the continued co operation a deep and special partnership with the eu but also we take this opportunity of brexit New trade deals around the rest of the world actually seeing how we can build a more prosperous stronger and fairer Britain. I think we can do that I think we can do that because I believe in Britain and I believe and the British people just over a year ago when you were a remainder. David Cameron got this wrong and he resigned. You got it wrong and remain to become Prime Minister, remaining inside the European make the European Union makes us more prosperous yesterday. You said brexit Makes us more prosperous. I mean. What. What. Where you wear you out on this what I. I set out very carefully before the referendum, why I believed on balance. We should stay in the Eu I also said the sky will not fall in. If we leave the eu. What then happened was the British people who had been given the choice. No, Parliament decided to say to the public. It's your choice. They chose that we should leave the eu will be going back to your own garden. You've got to make sure that we can actually use the opportunities that come from brexit We've got to grasp those opportunities. But, fundamentally, David. The thing I think that matters most in this is being willing to deliver on the will of the people not saying you've got it wrong. Let's have a second referendum saying you voted. You've chosen you want a government that's going to do it for you. I say to people. If you voted for brexit You need to make sure you get it with the government with me and my team who will actually deliver for you. Yeah, but the people chose made the wrong choice by your book, cos you were a leader. They made the wrong choice because you were remain or so in your mind. You must have thought, What are they on about, then. You said they'll get richer. If they stay if they leave. They won't that be poorer. Can you now honestly say there's no difference. We get. We get richer by leaving just the same as we would have done if we'd remain, which is what I said, Is there going to be a price. I did say at the time that I thought there were advantages on balance in being in the eu but now. What I believe we must do is deliver on the will of the people, but also make sure we make a success of it. So what I'm doing as Prime Minister is saying. Let's find those opportunities that will enable us to be more prosperous in the future. Right. Too much of me the man over there you, sir. And on the far side there. Yes, good event or do you say, Good evening, all the time you have met. That's a christening likely that we are going to have to pay a divorce. Bill and speculated anything between. Nothing. two hundred billion. Could you quantify in billions of pounds. Straightforward question. What is a good deal. I'm not going to give you a figure on that for two reasons. First of all because we need to go through very carefully. What. As part of the negotiation. What rights and obligations are the United Kingdom has. And secondly because if I gave you a figure here tonight. For what I thought would be a good figure that wouldn't be a very good negotiating stance. When I'm sitting down and let it. If I'm Prime Minister in eleven days' Time with the European Union. But it is his money or is it is it is it is it is money spending. Yes it. It's all our money that will be. It is taxpayers' Money. David, but you don't go into negotiating to her stance saying. The thing I want out of this is absolutely want out of this is, is ex because you can bet your bottom dollar. The other side to try and make sure you don't get it. Do you think they'll have to. You'll have to agree that before they'll talk about all the other things trade and all the rest of it, which we are doing that a day for. I've been very clear as indeed has the eu on recognising that we need to negotiate that new relationship with them, which will be about trade. But will be about other things to do like co operation on security and criminal justice, but they want to start off by talking about the the bill. I want one of the early discussions to be about the reciprocal arrangement for eu citizens and UK citizens. They haven't said, We can't negotiate the trade deal until we've agreed. The Bill, what they said is. We need to make sufficient progress. What. Several of them have also said we need to get onto the trade deal quickly won the very back there. And you've said that you think you can negotiate a good deal. But do you really think that you actually have any real level ridge with Brussels. Well, yes. I do. And one of the reasons. I think we can negotiate a good deal is because actually a good deal in Trade terms is not just of benefit to the UK, it's of benefit to businesses in the remaining countries in Europe is in remaining in the European Union. This isn't just about us. It's actually about a relationship that matters to them as well as it matters to us, you ever hear of the right. Um. Just let's pull on the common about Diane Arbus miscalculations made a few minutes ago. Cos Philip Hammond, who is the Chancellor of the Exchequer got twenty billion miscalculation. A few weeks ago. Well, what I will they say is this as I said earlier on and Diane Abbott wants to be Home Secretary and she wants to wipe the records of criminals and terrorists from the dna database. That would mean, we could catch fewer criminals and fewer terror. You said, Yes, I. It's, erm, talk about brexit And remain as I think the voting fifty two percent to forty eight percent. I think it lacked the confidence in asking the public. The electors to one more time. And because the water was so are in there in the middle. What with the lectures. Wanna do I think Nigel Farage made a big mess. I think Michael Gove or let the electorate, the wrong way and Boris Johnson, the buses. But are you a paste with nhs Three and fifty million. We all tell lies. So even people who voted out. Perhaps they should be given the second chance. So you should have the confidence to say. Shall we have another vote. Look. Can I just put it like this over the years in the euro and Union and its. its European Economic Community. There have been a number of occasions where referendums have been held in countries. There's one in Ireland. I think France's example, as well where they voted against what the eu was suggesting. And basically the bureaucrats and the eu politicians turned round those countries and said, You've got it wrong. Have another go. We want you to come up with what we think is the right answer. Do you know how that time was that at that. So you can come back in at that time I think collectively people here in the UK said you know what that's not the way to behave if the people have given their choice. Let's listen to the people and actually deliver on it on the rocks. We don't give the right information to choose from or get yourself earlier this week, Prime Minister. You said that you wanted the people of Britain to trust you with regards to brexit And winning the election. How come the people trust you when your manifesto is not giving them any detail as to figures or what you propose to do with other things in government. What. My manifesto. Right. I use that word trust and I used it because that is actually what politicians when we go out when we ask people to vote for us. We ask, are asking people to trust us in the in the role that we are, are being one to be voted into an I. If I look at a manifesto, what our manifesto has done is to be open with people about the great challenges that we believe that this country faces and that need to be addressed by whoever is in government. We've been open about that I've also been open that there will be some hard choices to be made in addressing those various challenges you talk about figures in our manifesto of course we have already have budgets that have been set out in the autumn statement is as government and in the spring budget and we've added some figures in various areas like our extra funding on the nhs And schools in the manifesto, but I think it's important that the next government should set out for people. The really big issues that are going to have to be addressed by whoever is in government and those are in our manifesto. The one. The one thing that was missing from your manifesto and seemed to cause a panic in the Conservative Party was the figures on what happens to people who have to fund their care in old age and we have a question about it from Derek Griffin. Let's just have that Griffin. Um. I was wondering, um. With regard to social care. Um. You can spend your whole life. Obviously, working hard to build up a nest egg and have a nice little pension savings. He can be comfortable in your later life after you've retired, but if it's all going to be taken away from you again. If you care is needed then essentially what. Why should you even bothered in the first place and a reminder that your manifesto said one hundred thousand pounds is all you'll be left with the well and the figure that you're left with that moment is twenty three thousand pounds. So we're actually quadrupling that. But you see the hundred thousand if I just look at. I thought I'd change that I do I thought so I thought you were going to have an upper limit. The hundred thousand is a floor. David years, tap, and a floor. But you didn't mention the captain. I come on to that in your inventions and Fester, that's all. Come on a tour of the figures, not answer. The question. I was. Do I. No, you're not. You're a way. Look at me the situation at the moment. If you need care are, then. If you've got more than twenty three thousand pounds in savings. You have to pay for that care. And if you need residential care. The value of your house will be taken into account and so it's today that we see people. Someone having to sell their house in order to pay those bills. What we say is that. Ask them. Don't the system we introduce which is important because we need a sustainable system for the future. Given the ageing population. If we do nothing a social care system will collapse and we say that we will ensure that people are able to protect more of their savings, one hundred thousand pounds that they will also not have to sell their house during their lifetime to pay for their care bills. I also wanted a system that was fair across the generations and I believe this is too. We said in our manifesto. We consult on the details. I heard the scaremongering that came out after our manifesto was published. And as an and I set out. One of the details that were aspects that would've been in the consultation and which is about having a cap on the absolute level. There's a floor of one hundred thousand. You can protect a hundred thousand and will consult on. What should be the cap of the absolute cap on the level of care. Funny. Had to leave out the cat, cos it's rather important for people one hundred thousand pounds at that you. You keep you keep, but whether you get rid of half a million or two hundred fifty thousand of that the manifested told you. Nothing. And then you suddenly said, Oh, they'll be a cat. We went charging more than certain. I want to leave that out, isn't it. We set out the principles in a manifesto, which are the ones that I've. I've just sent out in the answer, which is crucially, that it's fair across the generations that we enable people to have the knowledge and the comfort of knowing they won't have to sell their house in their lifetime to pay for their care, but very good. Welcome back on it because obviously I'm just from a personal perspective. I know you're saying about their caps or myself or my wife. For instance, we actually both, er, disabled, so again, statistically, as we get older, we are maybe more likely to be the ones that are needing to use that care. So there any kind of safeguards or guarantees or something that you know we're not going to be left bankrupt in a retirement place is purely because of the condition that we have no control over what I want. Want to do in relation to the details of the policy, how it actually works, including the level of the cap is to consult with people consult with voters also consult with organisations, charities and others working with older people, so that we ensure that we get that right. And I think that's a fair way to do it rather than. than just producing a figure. Now I think it's important to have that consultation. If you can tell us what the Flores now. Why can't you tell us the cap talking about. We're talking about two different things aren't we on the floor. I think it's important that we give people, the protection of their savings, which is greater than it is today. And that's why we have set that figure of one hundred thousand but on the cat as to where you set that figure is to the absolute figure that people pay amount that people pay. I think it's right that we have that consultation. We will consult as I've just said to Barry with individuals, but also with organisations that deal with these issues that charities that work with older people to make sure that we get that at the right level. OK, Victoria. Victoria. Let's go. It's not a night out. Oh, sorry. Yes, you're quick. We had a couple of years ago for seventy nine thousand I can't really start with something around that figure. Well, the day and we in our manifesto. We said we weren't following the deal. Not those of the the Andrew Dilnot proposals. We weren't going to follow those Andrew Dilnot proposals and there were two reasons why the first. Is that those tended to protect people who were wealthier, but didn't protect people who are on modest incomes and secondly, it required payment out of taxation and I actually think that if you're going to be fair across the generations and we don't ask young people and to be having their taxes increased in order to pay for their social care costs of somebody who made people who may be sitting on a very significant value in their house. Let's go. I think Tory or David. Well, yes. The nurse for twenty six years to the torrent expect us support in the light of another one percent pay increase. I what we're looking at in terms of the National Health Service and ensuring that we can provide the National Health Service in the future is if we just look at how much money is now being spent on the nhs And the five years to twenty. We will be spending half a trillion pounds on the National Health Service. Now we're putting more money in at the moment. And we will continue to put more money in into the future into the nhs But it is important that we recognise as you will know as a nurse. The demands on the nhs Are increasing all the time. We recognised the work that the nhs Staff do that the nurses get paid less and less nurses. Nurses get her an increase and obvious. Another man says, Well, if I were a real terms decrease. Yeah. fourteen percent since two thousand and turn. You don't tell us. We can already. Rise, let that person next set the mouse at that I agree with that my wage slips from two thousand and nine reflect exactly what I'm earning today. So how can that be fair in light of what we, the job that we actually do. And I recognise the job that you do that we had detained. We have now. We have had to take some hard choices. Across the public sector in relation to public sector pay restraint. We did that because of the decisions. We had to take to bring public spending under control because it wasn't under control under the last Labour government and I'm being honest with you in terms of saying that we will put more money into the nhs But there isn't a magic money tree that we can shake that suddenly provides for everything that people want. Aye, aye. You coming. Have you got em. You cut in nhs spending, but you also cut tax for the rich actually cutting nhs Spending. We're putting in fact, record levels of funding overall into the National Health Service and we will continue to increase the funding for the National Health Service in government of. So when funding is countries. Ben, way, ma'am, on their health service than we do, but we're giving out for free. So why. Why are we spending less well. It's not. I mean the figures do vary, but actually it's not the case that all other countries are spending more money on the nhs Than we are we are putting more funding into the nhs We're putting and we will continue to do that. But I also want to do some other things in relation to the nhs We have put into work into it a requirement that mental health should be given parity of esteem with physical health in the nhs I think there is with more money is going into it there. But there's more for us to do. And in our manifesto. We have set out a whole package of what we can do on mental health. It's not just about the money that's going into the nhs Which will increase it is about ensuring that we're dealing in addressing the issues. We need to and I think mental health is something that's been put to one side for too long and not been given the attention. It deserves the nurses just for a moment. I think it's fair that the nurses get just a one percent increase year in year out, regardless of inflation, so they get poor as some of them were told. Go to food banks. Is that fair. Do you feel. Do you sleep happy at that the public sector has been restrained in its paid one percent increase of course, there will be those working within the nhs Nurses and others who will get progression pay. Greece or not there was a special case when he's there. What that without the other one percent are not a special case. Nurses compared with other people in the public sector, people in the public sector across all sorts of services are working very hard on some jobs that we want them to do, because they are about looking after us about protecting us about caring for us, but we have to look at public sector spending. We have to make sure that we are managing our money carefully, because at the end of the day as I say there isn't a magic money tree that suddenly delivers all the money that everybody wants for their spending. Everybody wants you may hear later on that you can ask for anything you want have money spent on. But, actually. You can't. He's not. There we have to ensure we manage your money. taxpayers' Money carefully. A lot. So you're the one. You mentioned the mantel shelf there. I'm just wondering. Does that include the work capability assessment and that with their mental health as well, it cos I've just recently filed that assessment. So I just couldn't through mental health. There's a number of things you want and just used say your bit to you sitting together by Chancellor by chance. OK, we'll say what you're gonna say them gone. Oh, well, basically, again on mental health. I agree. It's so important. The nhs Is. Absolute shambles for mental health at the moment. I applied for nhs counselling about. I think probably the end. twenty fifteen. My first appointment is next Tuesday. My next appointment is next Tuesday. I've been waiting a year, half for this and I have suffered so much of that year in part because of the work capability. He said. Partially sighted as well. I'm partially sighted I have mental health problems and also I have other stews. So jaw issue and I went into my assessment and I was asked in detail about suicide attempts and I came out crying because I was so upset because of the way I was treated by that nurse and she came out after me she'd forgotten to measure my eyesight. I'm partially sighted she found time to bet to just a. You insult me, basically, by asking for all these up. Yeah, but I cried that runs. Look. Look, I'm not going to make any excuses for the experience that you've had. That's why I think it is so important that we actually did we do deal with mental health. You now. Both of you have raised two different issues. One is how we deal with mental health issues in the Health Service and the other is actually a work capability assessment and this is something where we are we do look at improving. What. How that assessment has taken place, but I know. I know your shit. I know that the issue of mental health is particularly difficult one to address in terms of those work capability assessments on the National Health Service and the other things we want to do with mental health and one of the things I want to do is ensure that there is better support in schools, so that we have in individual members of staff trained in schools who are able to better identify mental health problems and then know how to address them and I've had me. I was talking to a young woman. Only at the turn of the year. Who in schools said nobody really known what to be able to do with her with because of her mental health problems and so she suffered as a result. If we can give people, the support they need at an earlier stage. It's better for everybody, but act. But as I say I make no excuses for the experience. I want to know her as the woman is orange there. I'm sorry. We've got to go on to have only got ten more minutes. The Prime Minister. Yes, I think it's fair to say that mental health funding is one of your sound bites. Whenever people ask you about the nhs But it really concern me a couple of weeks ago. You were filmed when a lady challenged you about her benefits for learning difficulties. You turned around and gave her answer about mental health funding and it really concerns me that the Prime Minister and potential future Prime Minister of the UK apparently doesn't understand the difference between a learning disability and mental health condition to me back when the lady first spoke to me. She talked about learning disabilities and mental health and she'd actually raise mental health herself, but recognise that this particular issue that she had was about learning disabilities, but look. This is that both of these are areas where we need to ensure that we have got the ability for people's needs to be identified at an early as early a stage as possible and then the support goes in all. Obviously, all the evidence is the earlier. You can get that support to somebody early. You can identify an issue, then. Then the better. It is for that individual, but also at the better. It will be for them for the rest of their lives. That's why on mental health front. I say I'm so keen to ensure that we get more support in terms of training in schools and other things I want to do as well. But getting including in the workplace, actually, because too often. I think there was discrimination in relation to mental health in the workplace. So I want to bring a new Mental Health Act, get a scrap the old Mental Health Act, but also change the equalities legislation. So that discrimination on mental health would not be possible in the workplace. Robert, wait. Let's have you, Sir Robert he. I will be the voting tarry, but I'm not happy with the foreign aid budget and especially where we're giving money to North Korea. Can you explain that, please. Well, we. I think the the commitment. We have given on the foreign aid budget is an important one and I think it's an important one for two reasons. First of all out. We are one of them are you know the, er. How were the fastest growing second fastest growing economy in the G seven. Last year, we are on the most significant economies in the world. I think it's right that we say we help those a take on those people who are less well off than we are in those developing countries. There are millions of children. Millions of girls being educated today. Who would not be educated were it. Not for the foreign aid money that we're giving. But it's also about something else because it means that in certain states it's possible to help to develop the economy, the governance of that state and that is of benefit to us in protecting us as United Kingdom for a whole range of reasons. If we can stabilise. Some of certain countries, then that's going to be better for us both into in terms of security for example. Robert, where you do look very carefully at individual countries and individual payments, about North Korea that. That is that is one of the worst places, going, surely. Well, it's certainly not somewhere that are. I would do it suggests that is somewhere that I hold up as a paragon of virtue. I think what the dprk What North Korea has been doing in terms of its missiles and it's a nuclear situation and we had another ballistic missile test. Only a few days ago, we are very clear that we want to see those changes in North Korea. I think it's important for China to be influencing them as the two going career. Does North Korea received money from the aid budget. The gentleman has suggested that it that it is. I don't know the details of that only in pounds in twenty fifteen. four million pounds. Yeah. OK You, sir. In the red and white checked shirt. So you're. you're the Prime Minister of the country. You don't know where that foreign aid is going to. It's going to government or is actually going to benefit people. Well, if we're if we are putting money into when we put money into countries we change the way we spend the foreign aid budget in the past foreign aid budget was all too often just given to governments and you know the stories in the past have them the way the money was then spent so we work through NGO goes. We work through organisations that are helping people. So money that we put into countries is targeted on things like education on health on a welfare of people on support for the people who are the most vulnerable. OK, brief one from you, sir. Earlier, of foreign aid money. Can you explain why it is that a great deal more of a largesse that goes to the rest of the world is not in the form of British manufacturers, rather than of cash. It's much easier to avoid having a field hospital pocketed than it is a few million of different of cash and it's also the case that if this bunny fed its way through British manufacturing and provided British jobs. There would be much less contention concerning the sums of money. They won't. Can you answer briefly. First of all. Some of the money. We're talking about is not about buying kit in the sense of things that will be manufactured here. I just said, If you're talking about education and it's about providing the facilities where children who would not otherwise be educated, are being educated. Um, but we do give support to countries in ways. Other than just the money. Um. So there are some countries where we are indeed a military are working on things like field hospitals and providing those directly. If we want to improve British manufacturing and manufacturing around the world. That's why I want to ensure we get lots of good trade agreements around the whole of the world. When we leave the European Union. OK, Sally. Sally Jones. He sat selling guns. Not far away over state schools are underfunded and teachers have ever wet. Why. You put money into grammar schools with state schools are beneficial to Al delicacies. OK, I have stick the Grammar School from has, yes. But Sally. What with what we're doing the grammar schools will be within the state sector. But they might be free schools. But there might be others. Other types of schools. We want a diversity of education because education is so important. I want every youngster to get the best possible start in life and that means every youngster getting the education. That is right for them. We are actually putting more money. You said, We're putting money into were possible for possibility for grammar schools to be set up. Yes, but we are also increasing the overall amount of money that goes into schools and ensuring there is a fairer distribution of that money across the country, but I believe it's important that if we know. There are good schools out there at the moment. We have a law that says, You can't set up any more of these types of schools. Despite the fact that they're good. I think that's wrong. I should think we should allow those news grammar schools to be set up. So we ensure every child gets the education. That's right for them the best possible start in life, what he from in the school that I work in by twenty every single child in that school will receive eight hundred eight ninety eight pounds per year less than under a Labour government in twenty and my question to you is why do you care less about the children. The Labour government. I don't care about that I don't have that per child per there. You're saying the per child per pupil spending all has fallen and, um. by twelve years ago. But how much. eight hundred ninety eight. OK, made the point. Let's blow as there are two things I want to do, because I do care about education as I've just said in response to Sally. I think it is so important for every youngster to get the best start in life. And that's why we will be putting more money overall into the schools will be ensuring the pupil premium is there for those children who are a disadvantage. We will also ensure that there is a fairer distribution of school funding was at the moment. As you probably know. There are some schools that get twice the amount of money per pupil than others. Other schools in other parts of the country. I want to see a fairer system of funding and in doing that we will make sure that no school sees a budget cut when that a fairer funding introduced for getting a good quality education isn't just about the money going into schools. It's about ensuring that we are encouraging people to come into the teaching profession. So we'll give loan student loan forgiveness. People who stay. Come into teaching and stay in teaching. It's about a diversity of types of school. So is the innovation and creativity in education. So we genuinely injured can say in this country that. How far you go in life depends not on where you come from or who your parents are, but it depends on your talents and your abilities and your willingness to work hard. Fred got a couple of minutes left, Matt. Randy. He Dundee holder. Let's have your question. Um. Why haven't you signed a letter to Donald Trump condemning his decision to pull out of the Paris. Climate Change agreement, something which the it's Germany, France and Italy have done. Yes And, er. I haven't, because I. I actually have spoken to Donald Trump and told him that the UK believes in the Paris agreement and we didn't want the United States to leave the Paris agreement at the G seven leaders sat round the table last week and spoke to were told Donald Trump that the six of us. Told him that we believe the Paris agreement was an important international agreement on climate change that we wanted the United States to stay in it. I've spoken to him. I spoke to him last night about this what he's sadder and Japan, haven't signed the letter, either. What. Sorry. Say what did he say. He says he's taken the decision because he thinks it's in the best interest of America. I say that the Paris agreement actually is important for us, globally. In terms of dealing with climate change. That's why the UK supported it. It's why the UK is to your. your. your negotiating your negotiating our departure from the eu would. He'd have been sensible and prudent to go along with France and Germany and Italy and sign a letter to Donald Trump and said if it being released that you just said you were disappointed by his decision. It's not a question of when we should go along with somebody else. David, we take independent decision as the UK. I spoke to Donald Trump, I've told him my views from the UK, his position. Last week. I told him last night. What a views are we remain committed to the Paris agreement we continue to think it's important for dealing with climate change internationally well that I'm afraid, ends the first half of this programme. Prime Minister. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. And now. Will you please welcome the leader of the Labour Party. Jeremy Corbyn Good evening. Good evening, mr Corbett. Our first question to you comes from Kieran Hepworth, please. And why should the British public trust you and pays to negotiate. brexit Why should the British public trust you and your peers to negotiate. brexit Thank you for inviting me here tonight. I'm very sorry. This is not a debate. This is a series of questions. I think it's a shame. The Prime Minister. A very, very clear on brexit The referendum took place a decision was reached leaving European Union. Secondly, we will immediately legislate in office to guarantee the rights of eu nationals to remain in this country. Secondly, we will negotiate with the European Union to guarantee trade access to European markets and protection of the conditions that we've achieved. To eu membership because it's crucial protect our manufacturing industry. Your point about a negotiating team. We have a great team a great team of very experienced people kissed Amma is one of the leading lawyers of this country. I think I can trust kissed armour. With negotiations more than some other people who are undertaking those negotiations on Question Time last night. Your international trade secretary. Barry Gardiner said that Britain would. Absolutely. Absolutely. Was his word. The poorer. After leaving the eu. Do you agree with that I don't think we necessarily would be poorer. I hope that we will retain as I said the trade access. I hope also that we will have a Labour government will be investing in a growing economy in this country and challenging the terrible levels of inequality that exists in this country at the same time you, Sir David Cameron went to the eu and asked for a few concessions. He got nothing because they knew that he would stay in. You would want to stay in the eu if the eu and understands your position that no deal. He's a bad day. Then you've got no chance here. I've made it very clear. We accept the results. The referendum and I think it's important to go from that point. I've made the point also about the need for trade access to the European Union and there is. Of course, an interesting that on both sides. The Channel. Most of our big manufacturing companies have supply chains here and in Europe and vice versa. There is a mutual interest in this, but we're not approaching these negotiations by threatening Europe with setting up some kind of low tax haven for big corporations in this country we. Instead, saying, We want to continue that trading relationship outside the European Union. But I think a sensible relationship with them is very important. And I would approach those negotiations to build up a Trust, which gives us that sensible relationship in the future, what you're not exactly what exactly do you think the British people meant who voted to leave. What do you understand by leave the eu. What does that actually mean to you to label. The eu. What is it that matters. And that leaving the European Union means withdraw from the Treaty of Rome. We withdraw from the nineteen seventy two decision was made by the British government at that time to join the European Union. It means that there is no longer a legislative authority over UK law within the eu or a parliamentary consent for it. It means we have to have an independent and separate relationship with the European Union and I think we've got two years to negotiate it. And I can't wait to get started and to make sure that we do retain manufacturing industry and service industry jobs in Britain that are so essential to our economy and the economic gross. You threatening will not work is your aim to remain there. You are. And you enter in the single market. Do you think that's possible. Our aim is to have a tariff free trade access to Europe. I think we should put it in those terms, rather than anything else at this stage. OK You, sir. Over there, the far side. No, the man over there. That's it cos he's spoken already. You will learn. Will you rule out doing a deal with Nicola Sturgeon in the event of a hung parliament because you will be negotiating. You would expect with the eu we are fighting this election to win and we're mounting a fantastic campaign in order to get that message across of how different. Our society and our politics could be. We are contesting all the constituencies, we are not looking to do deals with anybody. We are not forming a coalition government. I want to form a Labour government with a majority to carry out this amazing programme which can give so much. OK, so he has at eight. It did, but it wasn't the answer to my question. I thought you're there. I thought the question was about deals and I said no deals. OK, I gotta get something else. You said there in the brochure. Given the absence of the European Court of justice. How. When you uphold government. Accountability post brexit On environmental issues. For example, a pollution were already breaching limits. European Court of Justice, holds two accounts. What will happen when we leave. I want to ensure that the environmental protocols are adopted into UK law. I think it's very important to do that it's also absolutely crucial for the future of all of us that we have agreements with all of Europe. Be they part of the eu or not on air pollution on air quality on Sea pollution and protection of our seas and our natural environment and I'm very determined to achieve that. And since you raise the subject. I utterly deplore Donald Trump's decision to withdraw from the Paris climate change. I would sign a letter with any other leader. That would. You've got that straight away. Yeah. Let's, er. Yeah, let's. let's come home for a moment of Steve run. Let's have your question, please, yeti, Rudd. I it. Yes, I am a small local business. Um. I'm faced with the possibility of higher corporation tax rates. Obviously, we've alluded to the uncertainty that, brexit Will create over the next couple of years. And today. You've talked about creating jobs and I just wonder how I can have confidence that those jobs while eyes are small business can create those jobs. Well, I don't know how big your small businesses. So Lycra businesses small micro service business. This big that big, but I employ five people. Oh, small business, but it could grow good. Let's hope it does glow growing in uncertain times. That's absolutely what you just. Specify. Again. What are your problems with the proposals that Labour's making. Well, obviously, it's. It's the rise in corporation tax is the uncertainty of brexit And that the outcome from brexit It's is planning ahead. Basically, my problem is OK And obviously we've got the personal taxation issues that you know, creating crate and other issues that further down the line. I'm sure you recognise there are huge problems in the funding of our public services, health, education and these have to be addressed and dealt with. We have a fully costed and fully funded manifesto here. That will cost. Yes And we will raise corporation tax up to twenty six P by the end of the parliament that will be actually two percent lower than it was in two thousand ten will actually less than the G seven average. It will also do is not to raise corporation tax for small and medium businesses by that amount. Some will have no rise whatsoever. And we have had a very interesting and very good discussions with a lot of small businesses about their problems accessing capital, their problems are growing because banks don't like them are not interested in them and the need to have an investment strategy for this country, so on top of that we will also be forming a national investment bank to improve infrastructure. All across the country and develop new high technology industries which I think are the future of this country. Unharness or heart. Let the people with the skills actually develop the jobs and develop the industries in this country and so. Yes, we are asking the very biggest corporations to pay a bit more, but I tell you what I think it's worth it. It's worth it so that any young person can go to university and not leave with debt. It's worth it to make sure school. Head Teachers don't have to collect at the school gate in order to pay the teachers' salaries. I think it's worth it for a better society. In which everyone can achieve something. Come back to you. I'm also working for a while, nothing to accountancy firm. So we to deal with large businesses as well as potential clients and existing clients, Mike. Much, much choice. Basically, along choice of appliances, a Conservative government and a Labour government and the difference. He said two percent. Looking at a European wide. It's a nine percent difference between what the Conservatives are proposing corporation tax for large businesses and what the Labour government. It was. It's a fair question, but I would simply say this all of your clients. I'm sure require workers at various times they require skilled workers at various times. If we, as a society. Don't look at the problems throughout our school and education system and investing it properly. Where are the skilled workers going to come from tomorrow. Where are gonna be the consumers of tomorrow. I think it's time that we looked at in inequality in our society and used a public investment in order to improve services and give real chances to everybody. Poverty is a waste. People who can't get the education. They want and the qualifications. They want. We all lose. It's a question of whether the community gets together to support, everybody. Or we just let the rich get richer and the rest suffer. What's this. That's it. What's the overall increase in the tax take that a labour. If it comes to power would do would expect. What. What kind of percentage on the current tax, get forty eight billion more. How much. What percent is that what comes in at the moment. forty eight billion more, which is quite a small proportion of the total. The point. I'm making is that what we've got here is funding of it through corporation tax funding of it through some new taxes. At ninety five percent. ninety five percent of the people of this country will pay no more in tax the eighty or national insurance companies will be asked to pay a bit more and I think it's the right thing to do, because it does give us that a growing economy. The the figures for the country as a whole, the economy as a whole is very nearly a ten percent increase in tax take by the Government brings into question from Jack Rowse. If I'm a jack Rowse, please. Where is Jack Grouse. Yes. Speak away. Speak away hijack is Labour's manifesto. A realistic wishlist. Or is it just a letter to Santa Claus. I urge you to read it. I think it is a serious and realistic document that addresses the issues that many people in this country face. We've been brave enough to put it out there with all the policies that are in it. How we deal with the school funding crisis, how we make sure preschool. All children. Two to four get thirty hours of childcare. Per week or opportunities for pre school play and education, how we bring back. The Educational Maintenance Allowance, so that youngsters who would be deterred from staying on at school or going on to get. A levels or other qualifications and that those who can get into university won't end up with debts of fifty or sixty thousand at the end of it. This is nothing unusual in many other countries in the world. I think it's time for us to invest in our future. The other crisis. I. My mention David is the question of health. The question of mental health and the question of social care if we don't address it. What happens. What happens is more people suffer. What happens is more women usually give up work to care for those who cannot be cared for. Because we're not putting enough money into it. And those with a mental health crisis suffer alone. Don't get the help and support they want. We have to respect the needs of people and frankly challenge. All of us to say if we want to live in a society that genuinely cares for all we've got to be prepared to deal with the issues of inequality and pay for it. And I'm prepared to do that OK. Oh, yeah. It's a question of funding it. And I'm thinking of last time Labour were in government, the left. Not at the Chancellor's office saying we have no money left. What I would say. Is there, the past seven years of austerity that austerity has hit public sector workers with the one percent cap is hit all our schools and public services. It has caused a housing crisis and you know what the very richest our society have got richer. There's been more and more tax giveaways. At the top end and more and more charges at the other end. It's time to rebalancing our manifesto is a serious. Well thought out document that I believe is getting a lot of support and people are very excited by the idea of how we could do things differently. He said you say this manifesto serious and well thought out and you speak about creating an equal society free from racism and anti Semitism but how can I believe a word of this when you as party leader, have failed to expel one of your members. Ken Livingstone for his anti Semitic remarks. There, there is no place for anti Semitism anywhere in our society and certainly not in our party members have been suspended. If they have committed any remarks. He's not really seemed to be how to be seen to be of an anti Semitic nature. Those that have done that are suspended. We have a process that is independent of me within the party, which investigates. These and makes a decision on it. I deplore racism in any form whatsoever. The way in which the Jewish people have suffered down the centuries, the Holocaust and all that went with it was the most appalling stain in the history of mankind. I believe we have to fight racism in any form with every fibre of our being a society that cannot challenge racism is a society that is heading for division. I will not tolerate and a fast he. That's so important to you. How are you, sir. Fine. Some only suspending him for a short period of time. How was it. Not enough to. He has been suspended and further investigations may or may not happen after the election, but he is suspended from membership, but he's suspended so that the investigation into her as the woman there on the gangway. You. Yes, you are. I am I heard you recently commented that black and ethnic minorities potential has been like locked her and Conservatives and you plan to kind of free up and on rockets. I just want some clarification as to how exactly planned to do it. Sorry. Can I didn't follow you hear the question of the camera right in front that I'm sorry about that I said there was a recent comment by Red and news about you and purporting that black and ethnic minorities potential had been locked and Conservatives and soldiers on some clarification as to how you'd free up or knock it will in that regard the issues are of poverty in Britain, the issues are of differential levels of spending in inner city areas compared to other areas and there are serious issues about the number of young black people, particularly young men who are part of the criminal justice system end up in youth, youth custody or you or use a youth justice institutions or those that end up in mental health institutions. I think we have to look very seriously at levels of racism within our society. If you like, erm, racism that almost an institutionalised nature that has to be looked at and one of the issues we put forward was consider how difficult. It can be for somebody with an African name or a Muslim name to get a short list to get an interview for a job compared to others. And so I suggest it's a suggestion. It's may become our policy is that we should have them blind applications for jobs where there's no name involved as merely description of your skills and your ability and your qualifications, so that there can be a fair assessment of that person because we are a multi ethnic multilingual multicultural society. He doesn't treat everybody equally and give everybody a decent chance. Then we end up with poverty. We end up with discrimination and we end up with divisions. I want to see a country that comes together and is not divided and apparent by poverty or by discrimination. He may come back. Education and the economy in a moment, but let's have this question from Adam murder. Troy, please. Adam. Oh, good. If Britain were under imminent threat from nuclear weapons. How would you react. I'll do everything I can to ensure that any threat is actually dealt with earlier on by negotiations and by talks so that we do adhere to a record obligations under the Nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty that we do encourage China in its work in trying to bring about six party talks in the resolving the issue in North Korea and we do. Follow the leads that President Obama took in doing a deal with Iran, which would result in them not developing the nuclear capability. I think the idea of anyone ever using a nuclear weapon. Anyone. Where. In the world is utterly appalling and terrible. It would result in the destruction of their lives and communities and environment for millions of people and so I would be actively engaged to ensure that danger, didn't come about. I would also be very aware of other dangers that we face cyber attacks hit a National Health Service. A couple of weeks ago, the dreadful terrorist attack in Manchester indicates the danger of individual acts of terrorism that can take lives. We have to be secure. Here we have to protect our society and our country, but we also have to engage in the rest of the world to make sure we don't have huge uncovered spaces, such as in Libya, which can become the basis of some terrible events that are going to take the lives of many other people who have to deal with those issues here and globally. That is the function of responsible government. You're, um, committed to renewing Trident are you saying there are no circumstances in which you'd use a nuclear weapon. I'm saying all our party has committed to renewing trident. That was a decision taken by the party conference indeed taken by Parliament. I would view. The idea of having to use a nuclear weapon as something that was result, resulting in a failure in the whole world, diplomatic system. There has to be no first use. There has to be a process of engagement to bring about. Ultimately, global nuclear disarmament is not going to happen quickly. It's not gonna happen easily. But we have to have that wish you cannot have countenance a world. In which we could all be destroyed by nuclear war. You see no first use in. You wouldn't use. You wouldn't push the button in first use in retaliatory use. Would you you. Well, nuclear weapons that you're wealthy. His weapon is there is it. I say no first use of the weapon and I think that has to be the basis on what we do. Adams that answer your question. John, come back on it incredibly concerning that you wouldn't ever commit to doing. That's our safety. We had to look at first and foremost and government. But what particularly nice views that Trident isn't just for Heaven forbid a potential carbon government. It goes long beyond that are many decades into the future. So when you're making the decision whether to support this. And that is not just for. Right here. Right. Now it's threats that can face, but we have to do everything we can obviously to protect ourselves. But the best protection is having good and reasonable relationship to the rest of the world. So we don't descend into a mentality where there are military blocks. Starting threatening each other and I'm utterly determined to do everything I can to bring about a more peaceful world. I've spent a lot of my life with UN and other organisations trying to bring about Principal. No, first use principles of disarmament and principles of bringing about peace around the world that surely is something we can all work for. I think we have to recognise that there is deep, deep inequality and injustice in the world. But the threats are as I said a cyber security and terrorism. The other threats are actually of environmental disaster around the world and large numbers of people fleeing from environmental disaster in effect environmental refugees, which is why I was so disappointed in President Trump's decision, particularly in view of what we achieved by people working together to try and protect and sustain this planet. We've only got one planet. Let's get together. When we live on it and above all. Let's not destroy it. Can we just come. There are just come back to them a clear issue you a prime minister. You said you would have no first use. You wouldn't countenance Britain's nuclear deterrent would your party is restoring and rebuilding maintaining you wouldn't have her first use and that raises a question. He said under direct attack. Would you use it in retaliation, as Prime Minister. You're speaking to the country. About what you would do with the most expensive defence weapon that we have. Are you saying you would never use it. That's ace the most effective use of it is not to use it because it's there. Sorry. You're dodging the question. Aren't you. I'm saying. Are you there. No, sir, can look. He's under which you'd use it any. Sir, some senses, where anyone's prepared to use a nuclear weapon is disastrous for the whole planet. That is why there has to be a policy of disarmament and a globally, but through a multi natural multilateral policy not a unilateral that's the ideal. But what about the reality, where you're faced with the prospect of two men just. He just asking for a simple reality. The reality is that we have to obviously try to protect ourselves. We would not use its first use. And if we did use it. Millions are going to die. You have to think this thing through a side of the circumstances, a time for it. Yeah. You said that you would you use it a second youth. Or would you allow North Korea. ALSO media in Iran to bon mots and then say, Oh, we better start talking. You'll be too late, would allow them to do it. Of course not. Because what that does that is why I made the point. A short time ago. About the need for President Obama's agreement with Iran to be upheld. It's quite important, actually. And also to promote disarmament and career. That is difficult. I've pre shape, but impossible. Well, impossible. Or are you trying to do you up there. Yeah. You're asking a massive wish. When you've got one of the biggest Arsenal's by his side. A I'd rather have it and not use it than not have it all, especially in today's day and age. If you want to comment on that I do all right. Anybody you're the woman there. Yes, that's a stick with us and move on. Yes, I have a question regarding human rights. But this is use your question. Just before I don't know somewhere. Everyone in this room seems so keen on killing millions of people from that particular gone. No, you tell them. They're to people and I want to ask a question about your immigration policy. You've mentioned that you want to reunite families specifically that have being forced apart by Theresa May's current migration policies myself. My husband's recording this in America as he's at work. He was deported. In December, he was told he was too highly educated. Despite studying here. Um, getting an undergraduate and master's degree invested a lot in this country. I want to know whether you would consider reducing the financial threshold for family migration to be further in line with the national minimum wage for living wage. Yes, our manifesto has addressed this issue is very painful. Some of the decisions that are made where the frankly arbitrary level of income is chosen. Couples split apart families split apart and people like her the person you're talking about, have invested a huge amount of time and energy into this country, then removed from this country who loses. We all those family loses their children lose, we lose as society and we will change those immigration laws, so that there can be a proper family reunion. I think there has to be the right and sensible thing to do. Are you a favour. He owned favour, reducing immigration overall into this country or what's. I think will happen. Is this that we have a managed migration from outside Europe, which is based on family reunion and skill needs more investment. We have at the moment, free movement from within the European Union that ends. We leave the European Union will then have to be managed migration from Europe. We have to also recognise that those have migrated this country made a massive contribution to our society. I the health of all of us as depended depends on the work that's done by many people have made their homes here. What I think will happen. Is there will probably be some reduction in European migration, because we will also prevent, there being out recruitment of a groups of low paid workers from Central Europe to come here to undermine existing conditions are often not very good themselves and their damage the life chances of people in this country and be not actually very good for those have been brought in so we'll end overseas. Only recruitment and end. Those contract arrangements by which people have brought in particularly in the construction industry. You see you're just have another issue which we do have to address that is the skill shortage and skilled problem in Britain because we have not invested enough in industrial training. We have not invested enough in skilled training. We have not invested enough in training more doctors or nurses in this country until we do that we got a big problem. And so a whole approach approached our manifesto is about investment for the future and judge what you're a brexit Secretary. Shadow. brexit Secretary, Sir Keir Starmer said, which there'd been a huge amount of immigration over the last ten years, people understandably concerned about. I think it should be reduced when people voted brexit You think immigration was at the forefront of their mind. I think it was a big factor in it. I don't think it was the only factor, but it was a big factor. There is also an issue that a communities and local government are often not sufficiently funded to deal with groups of people coming in. So we would restore what Gordon Brown had in ninety two thousand nine to migrant impact fund. I have one or two more people come to you and then we go on to question coming up, Mike. Yes, gone away. mr Corbyn, we talk about the weapons before the one thing that worries me more at the moment as somebody is growing up in a family business is the changes the minimum wage. I read your manifesto yesterday and you are planning on increasing minimum wage to ten pounds. Now, the current plan for the national living wage and forecast, so that up to sixty thousand people could lose their jobs because of those increases in wages. So, firstly, how many jobs. What statistic. Have you been given by your economist to whoever works for you as to how many jobs will be lost. If it goes up to ten if it goes up to ten pounds an hour and secondly, how will you help that three million micro businesses in the United Kingdom who employ many people a minimum wage and already struggle to do that they're fair point question. The minimum wage was first introduced by the Labour government after nineteen ninety seven election. There were a lot of similar concerns and predictions which turned out. Not to be the case. And in fact, there was not any substantial number of jobless called it. The release catch up and it's been cut the wage increases were so small. If you look at the economic and comments around that time wage increases were so small, All the commentator said that. This is a massive waste change there such a big margin of error now and your policies and what was brought in. In nineteen ninety nine. You come back. Come back to your point. What we're proposing is ten pound an hour by twenty twenty. That would be a living wage. That would reduce our department work and Pensions Bill somewhat because you'd be reducing in. Work. Benefit payments to people being paid more. There are many big companies that could well afford to pay it and shouldn't be just paying the minimum wage. There are companies like a suspect yours. Small companies that would have problems. We fully recognise that we were therefore work with them either to give them tax relief for support in order to make sure that the living wage. The real living wage was paid, but they didn't close down as a result of it because as a society. We have six million people earning less than the living wage a million people on zero hours contracts. We have wage levels as a proportion of national income actually falling at the present time I think in their pockets will mean, people are better off, but also be an economic boost itself. I absolutely recognise the problems for small and micro businesses. That's why there would be a pathway to it for them with support from the government to achieve it and Edward had Edward Robbins has, sir. mr Corbyn, just mention the issue and robins. Where is Edward Robin's put your hand. Where are you there. Yes Good. Ah, yeah. zero hours contracts provide an easy way for students like myself to get casual. Flexible work. How was scrapping these contracts affect us. Labour policy to scrap zero hours contract. First of all zero hours contracts for many people mean a lifetime of stress and a lifetime of great difficulty. Imagine what it's like it was your sole source of income is a zero hours contract job. You wake up in the morning. You look at your mobile phone and see if your employer wants that day or not that week or not. You don't know what your income is going to be now. I do understand the point about students and others. Some companies. Some employers say, OK. We need people in a bar in a shop in a packaging. Place those kind of enterprises. We will pay you X number of hours per week on a flexible basis, so that you will have an average pay of say ten hours per week. That means those people are loyal to the company. Those people know what their income is going to be and that seems to me a much fairer way of doing it. So you have some security. What's going on and there are some employers that do that in towns with a large student population with students and it works quite well. Am I. What. Well, I'm not gonna stop you working. It's OK. You know where I was talking about more coming from us having the option for students and a scapegoat employed to say we want to work this time. This time. Not just getting told you. But you're working this many are working when you choose. Yes You're the so called Gig economy like riding for delivery services. Yes, I think the agreement should be that you come to a discussion with the employer. I can work for three hours on Monday, six thousand Thursday. Two hours at weekends. Something like that. And that's my work pattern. It's. It's not simple to manage for any employer. I fully understand that. But it does give the security to the individual. It also gives the employer, a wide range of work for workers that we're working and will be loyal to their employer and you said back there. Why have you never regarded the IRA is terraced. I've had it for the all acts of terror is it by anybody in Northern Ireland or anywhere else. And I think the Good Friday Agreement was a huge achievement was brought about when both communities, recognise their shared, but different past and brought about the idea of a power sharing government in Northern Ireland. I think that was an enormous achievement and it's been copied elsewhere in the world as a way forward. I don't approve of any terrorism any sort or any terrorist acts of any sort it only divides communities and kills people culottes. I mean he. He did kill a lot of people didn't they all deaths are wrong or killing is wrong. We have to develop and we did in Northern Ireland. Eventually, a very effective peace process. I think we should pay tribute to those in the Unionist community as well as those. The nationalist community for coming together to bring about the peace process. It was a truly remarkable experience and you, sir. Yes You didn't watch the me. Yeah, I thought you had that you've got the microphone over your head. You all rise. Well, you said, You didn't support the oil. I and you've also supported a Mas and other terrorist organisations. A Do you suspect the British people to vote for you to go and number ten when you suck, then supported. Then we seen you. He had not supported any of those organisations, what I've said is and I'm sure you probably agree with that if you were to bring about a peace process. Anywhere in the Middle East, bit Ireland be in a different situation, say Colombia or anywhere else. There has to be a coming together at some point to that college. Where do the fit in there people. They have a minute. Till when you tuck into that there has to be. Well, I was talking to representatives of the one of the Republican movement. Yes, actually. So was the government at the same time. Ian Paisley was indeed, thrown out of Parliament when he told the Government told Margaret Thatcher. She was actually talking to them. D'you know what I voted in Paisley shouldn't be thrown out of Parliament thought his voice should be heard in Parliament. You have to bring about a peace process by talking to people that you don't agree with you just talk amongst. You're not going to go, keep poking the man in front of you wanting to speak to me again. What. You owe me. So he would you want to speak. Are you trying. Just because it's done on. Like what I can do. OK, you've talked to these people. The party talked earlier and I talk about the nuclear option. Talking is the way you want to go. Yeah. David often sets and programmes tongued public to press red button. Are you saying you'll never, ever, under any circumstances, press the red button. I think we've discussed this at some length about the aspirations. We all have I do not want be responsible for destruction of billions of people. Neither do you. There we have to go and I just went back to economics. It's all very well for a socialist to stand there with his very nice little red book and say we're going to fund all these lovely programmes by taking more money from big business. But what's your plan for the economy. When those businesses. Turn round and say, OK. Keep your high taxes will go elsewhere. You look at the business. We're talking about actually doing very well. They've done extremely well over the past six years because their tax have been cut a great deal. I think we have to look at the problems of our public services. We have to look at the issues of what kind of economic future. We have we cannot go on being a low wage economy. Under spending on our public services investing less than any other industrialised country in our future. I would much prefer that we develop a national investment bank and strategy regionally based to improve rail broadband road communications. We improved. Investment in our industry for the future. We have a lower proportion of manufacturing industry in Germany. We have a lower level of productivity than Germany with a lower skill base than Germany. Why is there a difference. Because successive German governments. Almost irrespective of which party is a being prepared to invest in their infrastructure and their future. I think we should think about that and improve the economy of our own society and you know what that would lead to better economic growth. It would lead to better opportunities for everybody and I think this is an offer. That's important. I think it's time that we actually invested in our future, rather than presided over a decline. But he seemed to say you're saying businesses may scupper under the weight of extra taxation. Well, then there's already that issue of uncertainty with brexit Anyway, we've seen certain companies of one hour in and saying we stay with girl. Well, if you say to them what you gonna pay more tax when you stay here as well. So we don't have to stay. Well, actually. The corporation tax level that I'm proposing would actually be less than there is anywhere in the major industrial countries of Western Europe. Anyway, the crucial thing. And you're right to raise it has to be gaining tariff free trade access to the European market as the basis. On which they can continue with. Look at it. This way. If Airbus are in this country as they are they manufacture aircraft parts they manufacture satellite parts and the final assembly of the aircraft takes place in Toulouse. Some of the parts are made here. Some of the engines are made in other places. Some parts are made in Spain that final assembly takes place. If we don't have that tariff free access to European markets are they going to stay. Would they want to stay. Ask yourself that question. You could say the same for many other big manufacturing enterprises that is why the crucial thing has to be maintaining that economic relationship with Europe, outside membership of the European Union. That is the best way of guaranteeing jobs and growing manufacturing economy in Britain, but also the government is investing alongside them to improve skill levels and improve communication. A very. There's a point from you so that would take one last question. Quick. If you're nervous. Security earlier. A few months ago. You quoted on top. Well, you said on television that one of the things you would do if you were successful and coming into government was performed a strategic defence review. Have you just gone through a strategic defence review. Why do we need another one every government comes into office does a strategic defence review. There are serious issues about the shortage of ships in the Navy. There are serious issues about supplies of frigates. There are serious issues about Maritime Surveillance aircraft are not available that have to be addressed. There's a crucial issue of cyber security and cyber attacks have taken place on us as a crucial issue about terrorist attacks. I don't believe you make society safer by getting rid of twenty thousand police officers as this government has done since two thousand eight, the hand to hand in. So, Hannah. Lynsey, but very quickly there. Hannah, if you want is it right to scrap university tuition fees are such an immediate priority when there's so much else that needs doing in terms of living quality for so many people in Britain and just to say it's tighter. A toe. It cost a quarter of your entire spending. Why universe. I think we should invest in education for the future. And I do think that abolishing university tuition fees, means that any young person has then got the chance to go to university than get in. If you look at the process of applications at the moment number of working class students is dropping number coming from poorer communities is dropping. I want to see real access for everybody. I think that's the right thing to do it would not be unusual in many other parts of the world to do this. Listen, as a young person. Basically, I had the offer of free education. I didn't take it up. That was my choice. And I'm not. I'm not complaining about it. I don't think it's up to me and my generation to pull up the ladder on the generations coming behind. OK, but I want to see an education system that really does work for all so that every child can develop to their full potential, irrespective of their background and their life chances. They were musical and I'm sorry. We have to stop you there. Thank you very much indeed. But I've got someone once, so that. So that brings us brings us to the end of this edition of her. Thank you. Thank you all the time here to York to put questions to the two parties. We are going to be back on Sunday for a second. His programme. Nicola Sturgeon of the snp Tim Farron, the Liberal Democrats. That's a five to six on BBC One on Sunday. Until then, from York.
