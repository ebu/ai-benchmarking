      <p begin="00:00:02.00" id="p0" end="00:00:03.80">Tonight, the Prime Minister,<br />Theresa May,</p>
      <p begin="00:00:03.80" id="p1" end="00:00:05.92">the leader of the<br />Conservative Party,</p>
      <p begin="00:00:05.92" id="p2" end="00:00:09.96">and the leader of Labour Party,<br />Jeremy Corbyn, face the voters.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:09.96" id="p3" end="00:00:12.04">Welcome to Question Time.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:20.04" id="p4" end="00:00:23.92">So, over the next 90 minutes, the<br />leaders of the two larger parties</p>
      <p begin="00:00:23.92" id="p5" end="00:00:27.00">are going to be quizzed<br />by our audience here in York.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:27.00" id="p6" end="00:00:29.00">Now, this audience is made up<br />like this -</p>
      <p begin="00:00:29.00" id="p7" end="00:00:34.12">just a third say they intend<br />to vote Conservative next week.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:34.12" id="p8" end="00:00:37.12">The same number say<br />they're going to vote Labour,</p>
      <p begin="00:00:37.12" id="p9" end="00:00:39.56">and the rest either<br />support other parties,</p>
      <p begin="00:00:39.56" id="p10" end="00:00:42.00">or have yet to make up their minds.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:42.00" id="p11" end="00:00:45.12">As ever, you can comment<br />on all of this from home</p>
      <p begin="00:00:45.12" id="p12" end="00:00:48.24">either on Twitter -<br />our hashtag is #BBCQT -</p>
      <p begin="00:00:48.24" id="p13" end="00:00:52.80">we're also on Facebook, as usual,<br />and our text number is 83981.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:52.80" id="p14" end="00:00:55.48">Push the red button on your remote<br />to see what others are saying.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:55.48" id="p15" end="00:00:57.52">The leaders - this is important -</p>
      <p begin="00:00:57.52" id="p16" end="00:01:01.48">don't know the questions that are<br />going to be put to them tonight.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:01.48" id="p17" end="00:01:03.04">So, first to face our audience,</p>
      <p begin="00:01:03.04" id="p18" end="00:01:05.76">please welcome the leader<br />of the Conservative Party,</p>
      <p begin="00:01:05.76" id="p19" end="00:01:07.56">the Prime Minister,<br />Theresa May.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:07.56" id="p20" end="00:01:10.08">APPLAUSE</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:01:11.56" id="p21" end="00:01:12.60">Thank you.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:01:16.00" id="p22" end="00:01:17.60">Thank you very much. Thank you.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:21.52" id="p23" end="00:01:22.84">Good evening, Prime Minister.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:22.84" id="p24" end="00:01:26.60">Your first question comes from<br />Abigail Eatock, please.</p>
      <p style="s2" begin="00:01:26.60" id="p25" end="00:01:29.96">Why should the public trust anything<br />you say or any of your policies</p>
      <p style="s2" begin="00:01:29.96" id="p26" end="00:01:32.88">when you have a known track record<br />of broken promises</p>
      <p style="s2" begin="00:01:32.88" id="p27" end="00:01:34.68">and backtracking during your time</p>
      <p style="s2" begin="00:01:34.68" id="p28" end="00:01:37.28">as Home Secretary<br />and now Prime Minister?</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:01:37.28" id="p29" end="00:01:39.28">Well, thank you, David,<br />and thank you...</p>
      <p begin="00:01:39.28" id="p30" end="00:01:40.88">APPLAUSE</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:01:44.88" id="p31" end="00:01:46.28">Thank you, Abigail,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:01:46.28" id="p32" end="00:01:48.72">and can I first of all say<br />good evening to everybody,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:01:48.72" id="p33" end="00:01:51.92">and thank you for coming to be an<br />audience at this programme tonight,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:01:51.92" id="p34" end="00:01:54.28">which is an important part<br />of the election campaign.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:01:54.28" id="p35" end="00:01:56.00">Let me tell you about<br />some of the things</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:01:56.00" id="p36" end="00:01:58.84">that I did as Home Secretary,<br />Abigail.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:01:58.84" id="p37" end="00:02:00.28">I said that I would ensure</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:02:00.28" id="p38" end="00:02:02.88">that we were dealing with<br />extremist hate preachers,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:02:02.88" id="p39" end="00:02:06.60">and I excluded more than any<br />Home Secretary before me.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:02:06.60" id="p40" end="00:02:09.04">I said I would do something<br />about stop and search,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:02:09.04" id="p41" end="00:02:11.56">cos I don't think anybody<br />should be stopped and searched</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:02:11.56" id="p42" end="00:02:15.08">on the streets of our country<br />because of the colour of their skin.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:02:15.08" id="p43" end="00:02:17.08">I said I would be tough on crime,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:02:17.08" id="p44" end="00:02:20.72">and I said I would ensure our<br />police and our security services</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:02:20.72" id="p45" end="00:02:24.08">had the powers they need<br />to be able to do their job,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:02:24.08" id="p46" end="00:02:27.80">and I gave them those in the<br />legislation that I put through,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:02:27.80" id="p47" end="00:02:31.56">and I made sure that we kept the<br />records of criminals and terrorists</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:02:31.56" id="p48" end="00:02:32.80">on the DNA database,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:02:32.80" id="p49" end="00:02:35.12">whereas Diane Abbott actually wants<br />to wipe them clean,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:02:35.12" id="p50" end="00:02:36.68">and I don't think<br />that's a good idea,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:02:36.68" id="p51" end="00:02:38.32">cos that helps us catch criminals.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:38.32" id="p52" end="00:02:39.72">So, no backtracking, and...</p>
      <p begin="00:02:39.72" id="p53" end="00:02:41.32">APPLAUSE</p>
      <p begin="00:02:43.72" id="p54" end="00:02:46.72">..no broken promises?<br />What were you thinking of, Abigail?</p>
      <p style="s2" begin="00:02:46.72" id="p55" end="00:02:50.28">Erm... Well, you have backtracked<br />as Prime Minister.</p>
      <p style="s2" begin="00:02:50.28" id="p56" end="00:02:54.24">You backtracked when you became<br />leader of the Conservatives,</p>
      <p style="s2" begin="00:02:54.24" id="p57" end="00:02:57.88">and then immediately Prime Minister<br />after the referendum.</p>
      <p style="s2" begin="00:02:57.88" id="p58" end="00:03:01.04">You said you wouldn't call<br />an election, and you did.</p>
      <p style="s2" begin="00:03:01.04" id="p59" end="00:03:04.00">And then you are here<br />calling an election</p>
      <p style="s2" begin="00:03:04.00" id="p60" end="00:03:06.44">and refusing to take part<br />in debates,</p>
      <p style="s2" begin="00:03:06.44" id="p61" end="00:03:09.16">refusing to answer<br />people's questions,</p>
      <p style="s2" begin="00:03:09.16" id="p62" end="00:03:11.88">refusing to talk to Jeremy Corbyn,</p>
      <p style="s2" begin="00:03:11.88" id="p63" end="00:03:14.56">and you've backtracked<br />on your social care policy,</p>
      <p style="s2" begin="00:03:14.56" id="p64" end="00:03:17.12">and your entire manifesto<br />has holes in it,</p>
      <p style="s2" begin="00:03:17.12" id="p65" end="00:03:18.84">and everyone else can see that.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:03:18.84" id="p66" end="00:03:20.16">Well, first of all...</p>
      <p begin="00:03:20.16" id="p67" end="00:03:21.40">APPLAUSE</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:03:25.88" id="p68" end="00:03:27.60">First of all, can I just say,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:03:27.60" id="p69" end="00:03:29.40">I'm not refusing to take part<br />in debates,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:03:29.40" id="p70" end="00:03:31.80">because I'm here answering questions<br />from you,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:03:31.80" id="p71" end="00:03:33.36">this audience, this evening,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:03:33.36" id="p72" end="00:03:36.12">and that's what I think is important<br />in an election campaign.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:03:36.12" id="p73" end="00:03:38.32">It's not politicians arguing<br />amongst each other,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:03:38.32" id="p74" end="00:03:42.44">but actually listening and taking<br />questions from voters.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:03:42.44" id="p75" end="00:03:44.40">And you mentioned about<br />not holding...</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:03:44.40" id="p76" end="00:03:46.80">Saying I wouldn't hold an election<br />and now holding one.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:03:46.80" id="p77" end="00:03:50.64">You're right - I thought we needed<br />a period of stability,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:03:50.64" id="p78" end="00:03:55.12">but what became clear to me when we<br />went through the Article 50 process</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:03:55.12" id="p79" end="00:03:58.16">to trigger the process<br />of leaving the European Union,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:03:58.16" id="p80" end="00:04:00.20">to respect the will<br />of the British people,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:04:00.20" id="p81" end="00:04:03.56">was that other parties wanted<br />to frustrate those negotiations,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:04:03.56" id="p82" end="00:04:06.84">and wanted to frustrate<br />that will of the people</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:04:06.84" id="p83" end="00:04:08.80">that had been expressed<br />in the referendum vote.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:04:08.80" id="p84" end="00:04:11.12">And, you know, it would have<br />been easy - I could have said,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:04:11.12" id="p85" end="00:04:13.76">"OK, I'm Prime Minister, there's<br />another couple of years going -</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:04:13.76" id="p86" end="00:04:16.12">"why don't I just stay<br />and hang on in the job?"</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:04:16.12" id="p87" end="00:04:20.40">But I didn't do that. I've called<br />an election because of Brexit.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:04:20.40" id="p88" end="00:04:21.76">I was willing to do that</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:04:21.76" id="p89" end="00:04:25.92">because I think this is a really<br />important moment for our country.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:04:25.92" id="p90" end="00:04:27.52">We've got to get this right.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:04:27.52" id="p91" end="00:04:30.72">If we get it right, I'm optimistic<br />for the British people,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:04:30.72" id="p92" end="00:04:34.12">because I believe in the British<br />people, but we need to get it right.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:34.12" id="p93" end="00:04:35.44">APPLAUSE</p>
      <p begin="00:04:41.36" id="p94" end="00:04:43.52">Yes, the woman there.</p>
      <p style="s3" begin="00:04:43.52" id="p95" end="00:04:46.72">Who is it that contested you,<br />because Labour have clearly</p>
      <p style="s3" begin="00:04:46.72" id="p96" end="00:04:50.20">issued a whip to get people to vote<br />for Article 50 being passed.</p>
      <p style="s3" begin="00:04:50.20" id="p97" end="00:04:51.52">Besides the Lib Dems,</p>
      <p style="s3" begin="00:04:51.52" id="p98" end="00:04:54.08">who have kind of said that they<br />would like another referendum,</p>
      <p style="s3" begin="00:04:54.08" id="p99" end="00:04:55.32">I don't understand who it is</p>
      <p style="s3" begin="00:04:55.32" id="p100" end="00:04:57.68">that has contested your leadership<br />through Brexit.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:04:57.68" id="p101" end="00:05:00.32">Well, you're right, we got the<br />Article 50 legislation</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:05:00.32" id="p102" end="00:05:01.56">through Parliament.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:05:01.56" id="p103" end="00:05:04.56">That was important - it's triggered<br />the ability for us</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:05:04.56" id="p104" end="00:05:08.24">to start these negotiations,<br />and those negotiations, by the way,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:05:08.24" id="p105" end="00:05:11.68">start just 11 days<br />after election day next week.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:05:11.68" id="p106" end="00:05:13.56">So whoever comes in<br />as Prime Minister,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:05:13.56" id="p107" end="00:05:15.00">whoever comes in as a government,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:05:15.00" id="p108" end="00:05:17.72">has got to be ready<br />to actually get the ball rolling</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:05:17.72" id="p109" end="00:05:20.84">and start those negotiations<br />straight away.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:05:20.84" id="p110" end="00:05:23.80">But it was clear through<br />the discussions that we had</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:05:23.80" id="p111" end="00:05:27.32">around that time that the other<br />parties did want to frustrate us,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:05:27.32" id="p112" end="00:05:29.68">and you say... You talk about<br />the Liberal Democrats,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:05:29.68" id="p113" end="00:05:32.36">I mean, we have a situation at the<br />moment where if Jeremy Corbyn</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:05:32.36" id="p114" end="00:05:35.36">was to get into Number ',<br />he'd be being propped up</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:05:35.36" id="p115" end="00:05:38.20">by the Liberal Democrats and the<br />Scottish nationalists.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:05:38.20" id="p116" end="00:05:40.72">You'd have Diane Abbott,<br />who can't add up,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:05:40.72" id="p117" end="00:05:44.80">sitting around the Cabinet table,<br />John McDonnell, who's a Marxist,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:05:44.80" id="p118" end="00:05:46.92">Nicola Sturgeon, who wants<br />to break our country up,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:05:46.92" id="p119" end="00:05:49.84">and Tim Farron, who wants to take us<br />back INTO the EU,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:05:49.84" id="p120" end="00:05:52.32">the direct opposite of what<br />the British people want.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:52.32" id="p121" end="00:05:53.76">APPLAUSE</p>
      <p style="s2" begin="00:05:57.60" id="p122" end="00:05:59.64"><span tts:color="white">You, sir. </span>Thank you.</p>
      <p style="s2" begin="00:05:59.64" id="p123" end="00:06:01.92">That being said, Prime Minister,</p>

      <p style="s1" begin="00:25:49.88" id="p520" end="00:25:51.64">and there were two reasons why.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:25:51.64" id="p521" end="00:25:54.60">The first is that those tended<br />to protect people who were</p>

      <p style="s1" begin="00:25:58.48" id="p523" end="00:26:01.24">And secondly it required<br />payment out of taxation.</p>

      <p style="s1" begin="00:32:36.32" id="p655" end="00:32:39.44">One is how we deal with mental<br />health issues in the health service,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:32:39.44" id="p656" end="00:32:41.96">and the other is actually the<br />work capability assessment.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:32:41.96" id="p657" end="00:32:44.00">And this is something<br />where we are...</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:32:44.00" id="p658" end="00:32:48.24">We do look at improving<br />how that assessment has taken place.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:32:48.24" id="p659" end="00:32:53.88">But I know your... I know the issue<br />of mental health is a particularly</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:32:53.88" id="p660" end="00:32:58.04">difficult one to address in term of<br />those work capability assessments.</p>

      <p style="s1" begin="00:32:59.44" id="p662" end="00:33:01.68">and the other things we want<br />to do with mental health,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:33:01.68" id="p663" end="00:33:05.64">one of the things I want to do is<br />ensure better support in schools</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:33:05.64" id="p664" end="00:33:09.60">so that we have individual members<br />of staff trained in schools</p>

      <p style="s1" begin="00:33:33.24" id="p673" end="00:33:37.36">But as I say, I make no excuses<br />for the experience that you had.</p>

      <p begin="00:34:06.84" id="p686" end="00:34:08.16">APPLAUSE DROWNS OUT SPEECH</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:34:11.76" id="p687" end="00:34:14.84">In fact, when the lady first spoke<br />to me, she talked about learning</p>

      <p style="s1" begin="00:34:16.48" id="p689" end="00:34:18.92">She'd actually raised mental<br />health herself.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:34:18.92" id="p690" end="00:34:21.20">But I recognise that<br />the particular issue she had</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:34:21.20" id="p691" end="00:34:22.80">was about learning disabilities.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:34:22.80" id="p692" end="00:34:26.52">But this is... Both of these are<br />areas where we need to ensure</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:34:26.52" id="p693" end="00:34:31.36">that we've got the ability<br />for people's needs to be identified</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:34:31.36" id="p694" end="00:34:33.88">at as early a stage as possible</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:34:33.88" id="p695" end="00:34:35.84">and then the support goes in.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:34:35.84" id="p696" end="00:34:37.44">Obviously, all the evidence is,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:34:37.44" id="p697" end="00:34:39.88">the earlier you can get<br />that support to somebody,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:34:39.88" id="p698" end="00:34:41.88">the earlier you<br />can identify an issue,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:34:41.88" id="p699" end="00:34:44.88">then the better it is for that<br />individual,</p>

      <p style="s1" begin="01:12:03.76" id="p1442" end="01:12:06.92">What I think will happen is this.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="01:12:06.92" id="p1443" end="01:12:11.32">That we have managed migration<br />from outside Europe,</p>

      <p style="s1" begin="01:12:19.36" id="p1447" end="01:12:21.20">That ends when we leave<br />the European Union.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="01:12:21.20" id="p1448" end="01:12:24.36">We'll then have to have managed<br />migration from Europe.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="01:12:24.36" id="p1449" end="01:12:27.20">We have to also recognise that those<br />who have migrated to this country</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="01:12:27.20" id="p1450" end="01:12:29.68">have made a massive contribution<br />to our society.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="01:12:29.68" id="p1451" end="01:12:33.08">The health of all of us depends on<br />the work that's done</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="01:12:33.08" id="p1452" end="01:12:35.32">by many people who have made<br />their homes here.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="01:12:35.32" id="p1453" end="01:12:36.88">What I think will happen</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="01:12:36.88" id="p1454" end="01:12:40.80">is there will probably be some<br />reduction in European migration,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="01:12:40.80" id="p1455" end="01:12:45.00">because we will also prevent there<br />being recruitment</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="01:12:45.00" id="p1456" end="01:12:48.52">of groups of low paid workers from<br />central Europe</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="01:12:48.52" id="p1457" end="01:12:51.48">to come here, to undermine<br />existing conditions</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="01:12:51.48" id="p1458" end="01:12:53.48">that are often not very good<br />themselves,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="01:12:53.48" id="p1459" end="01:12:57.64">and damage the life chances of<br />people in the country</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="01:12:57.64" id="p1460" end="01:13:00.24">and be not actually very good for<br />those who have been brought in.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="01:13:00.24" id="p1461" end="01:13:02.68">So we will end<br />overseas-only recruitment</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="01:13:02.68" id="p1462" end="01:13:05.08">and end<br />those contractual arrangements</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="01:13:05.08" id="p1463" end="01:13:06.44">by which people are brought in,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="01:13:06.44" id="p1464" end="01:13:08.44">particularly into<br />the construction industry.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="01:13:08.44" id="p1465" end="01:13:10.88">Also, if I may say so,<br />we have another issue</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="01:13:10.88" id="p1466" end="01:13:14.00">which we do have to address,<br />and that is the skill shortage</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="01:13:14.00" id="p1467" end="01:13:17.00">and skill problem in Britain because<br />we have not invested enough</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="01:13:17.00" id="p1468" end="01:13:20.88">in industrial training, we've not<br />invested enough in skill training,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="01:13:20.88" id="p1469" end="01:13:23.56">we've not invested enough in<br />training more doctors</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="01:13:23.56" id="p1470" end="01:13:25.52">or more nurses in this country.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="01:13:25.52" id="p1471" end="01:13:28.16">Until we do that, then we've got<br />a big problem,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="01:13:28.16" id="p1472" end="01:13:30.48">and so our whole approach to<br />our manifesto</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="01:13:30.48" id="p1473" end="01:13:32.64">is about investment for the future.</p>
      <p begin="01:13:32.64" id="p1474" end="01:13:33.68">Yeah.</p>
      <p begin="01:13:37.24" id="p1475" end="01:13:40.56">I'm thinking of what<br />your Brexit Secretary</p>
      <p begin="01:13:40.56" id="p1476" end="01:13:43.44">or shadow Brexit Secretary, I should<br />say, Keir Starmer, said,</p>
      <p begin="01:13:43.44" id="p1477" end="01:13:45.64">which is, "There has been a huge<br />amount of immigration</p>
      <p begin="01:13:45.64" id="p1478" end="01:13:48.40">"over the last ten years, and<br />people are understandably concerned</p>
      <p begin="01:13:48.40" id="p1479" end="01:13:50.12">"about it. I think it should be<br />reduced."</p>
      <p begin="01:13:50.12" id="p1480" end="01:13:51.36">When people voted Brexit,</p>
      <p begin="01:13:51.36" id="p1481" end="01:13:53.88">do you think immigration was at the<br />forefront of their minds?</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="01:13:53.88" id="p1482" end="01:13:55.20">I think it was a big factor in it.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="01:13:55.20" id="p1483" end="01:13:58.32">I don't think it was the only<br />factor, but it was a big factor.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="01:13:58.32" id="p1484" end="01:14:01.48">There is also an issue that<br />communities and local government</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="01:14:01.48" id="p1485" end="01:14:03.84">are often not sufficiently funded</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="01:14:03.84" id="p1486" end="01:14:06.20">to deal with groups of people<br />coming in,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="01:14:06.20" id="p1487" end="01:14:10.12">and so we would restore what<br />Gordon Brown had in 2009,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="01:14:10.12" id="p1488" end="01:14:11.80">which was a migrant impact fund.</p>

      <p style="s2" begin="01:14:17.48" id="p1492" end="01:14:19.64">Mr Corbyn, we talked about<br />nuclear weapons before,</p>
      <p style="s2" begin="01:14:19.64" id="p1493" end="01:14:21.60">but one thing that worries me more<br />at the moment</p>
      <p style="s2" begin="01:14:21.60" id="p1494" end="01:14:23.56">as somebody who's grown up in a<br />family business</p>
      <p style="s2" begin="01:14:23.56" id="p1495" end="01:14:25.00">is the changes in the minimum wage.</p>
      <p style="s2" begin="01:14:25.00" id="p1496" end="01:14:27.20">I read your manifesto yesterday,</p>
      <p style="s2" begin="01:14:27.20" id="p1497" end="01:14:30.28">and you are planning on increasing<br />the minimum wage to &#163;10.</p>
      <p style="s2" begin="01:14:30.28" id="p1498" end="01:14:33.08">The current plan for the<br />national living wage,</p>
      <p style="s2" begin="01:14:33.08" id="p1499" end="01:14:36.12">forecasts say that up to<br />60,000 people could lose their jobs</p>
      <p style="s2" begin="01:14:36.12" id="p1500" end="01:14:37.76">because of those increases in wages,</p>
      <p style="s2" begin="01:14:37.76" id="p1501" end="01:14:42.12">so, firstly, how many jobs - what<br />statistic have you been given</p>

      <p style="s2" begin="01:15:15.16" id="p1512" end="01:15:17.04">Yes, but, Mr Corbyn, the reason<br />that happened</p>
      <p style="s2" begin="01:15:17.04" id="p1513" end="01:15:19.44">is because the wage increases<br />were so small.</p>
      <p style="s2" begin="01:15:19.44" id="p1514" end="01:15:22.08">If you look at the<br />economic comments around that time,</p>

      <p style="s1" begin="01:15:43.00" id="p1522" end="01:15:47.72">That would reduce the Department of<br />Work and Pensions bill somewhat,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="01:15:47.72" id="p1523" end="01:15:50.00">because you would be reducing<br />in work benefit payments</p>

      <p style="s1" begin="01:16:03.16" id="p1529" end="01:16:05.04">We would therefore work with them,</p>
