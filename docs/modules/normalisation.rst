Normalisation
=============

Each normalisation class has a method called `normalise`:

.. code-block:: python

    def normalise(text: str) -> str:
        """Returns normalised text with rules supplied by the called class.
        """

.. automodule:: conferatur.normalisation.core
   :members:
   :undoc-members: normalise
   :inherited-members: normalise
