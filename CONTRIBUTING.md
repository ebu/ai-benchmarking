# CONTRIBUTING - Draft

This project has a [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) that we expect all of our contributors to abide by, please check it out before contributing.

## Pull requests and branching
- Before working on a feature *always* create a new branch first. (or fork the project).
- Branches should be short lived
- Once work is complete push the branch up on to GitHub for review. Make sure your branch is up to date with `master` before making a pull request. eg use `git merge origin/master`
- Once a branch has been merged into `master`, delete it.

`master` is rarely committed to directly unless the change is quite trivial or a code review is unnecessary (code formatting or documentation updates for example).
