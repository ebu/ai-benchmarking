# High level diagram

At the heart of the benchmarking framework is an open source toolkit. This library is supported and supplemented by other contributions. For example, it may be necessary to define a stadard format to test data, or to build a web UI for quickly assessing vendors without deploying the toolkit locally. See below for descriptions of the different components.

## EBU/User Test data
Users of the framework are expected to benchmark STT vendors using test data that matches their specific use cases (such as language,  handling background noises or a wide range of accents). In addition, a central reporsitory of test data sets can be maintained by the EBU and used in cases where a unique test set cannot be provided. 

## Test set format guidelines
Guidelines preparing the test data, for example how to handle composite words (e.g. backup/back-up/back up). These guidelines will be implemented by the _Test Data Normalises_.

## Transcript format guidelines
Guidelines for standardising the format of the transcripts geenrated by the vendors. These will be used by the _transcript normalizers_ so that the analysis of the transcript can proceed based on a single format. 

## Metric guidelines
Agreed definitions of metrics and how to implement them. 

## UI/reports
A hosted deployment of the toolkit and/or periodic reports generated by using the toolkit.

## Test data normalizers
Apply the _test data format guidelines_ to create consistently formatted data sets.

## Vendor connectors
Each of these connects to an STT vendor in order to create transcripion jobs. 

## Transcript normalizers
Implement the _transcript format guidelines_ to create consistently formated transcripts prior to analysis.

## Metric analyser
Each of these socres the transcripts returned by the providers using a single metric (for example Item Error Rate).

## Results metrics
Lists the scores for the selected metrics for the selected providers.
